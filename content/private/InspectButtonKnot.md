# How to Inspect a Button Knot Soft Shackle

Soft shackles are one of the most common connectors used in highline rigging, being used in both anchors and connections. And the most common variety of soft shackle is the button knot. Anecdotally, soft shackles are also home made more than any other piece of gear in highlining. It is probably just as likely that a soft shackle in a random highline rig was made at home as it was bought from a manufacturer. Unless it's your own gear and or there is a distinctive marking like a unique sleeve, it's likely you won't know the provenance of the soft shackles you use. 

With the wide variety of sources for soft shackles, it's especially important to know how to inspect them. The fact that soft shackles can be home made is a double edged sword. On the one hand it's a manual process, and with a little practice anyone can make a soft shackle as well as any manufacturer. On the other hand if someone isn't careful, and especially if they don't know how to inspect their work, then they can make bad and even unsafe soft shackles. This issue isn't unique to home made shackles either, as even reputable slackline manufacturers have sold poorly made soft shackles throughout the years. 

The good news is soft shackles are easier to inspect than they are to make. This article will go over a few different soft shackle incidents to motivate the importance of inspections, and then cover the details of inspecting button knot soft shackles. It's important to check that the noose is the correct size, that the button knot is tied and set correctly, and that the dyneema is in good condition. 

### Soft Shackle Incidents

Soft shackles have been around since [at least 2009]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jH66tGsWv_Y), and based on posts from SlackChat have been common in slacklining since 2014. Despite over 11 years of use in the sport, the only well documented case of a soft shackle opening in a highline rig was [this incident in Philadelphia](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/163BZdHjmT/). While the primary cause of the incident was the noose being installed above a sheath, helping it come up over the button knot under tension, the noose of the shackle was also clearly too large. Its likely that the oversized noose at least partially contributed to the incident. While there are no other well documented cases of soft shackles opening in a rig, I know of 2 more cases rumored in the community of loose soft shackles shaking open while attached to the backup. While we don't know the specifics of these incidents, they point to the possibility of soft shackles opening accidentally without a sheath interfering with the noose. 

In addition to the reported (and purported) cases of soft shackles opening, there have been documented cases of soft shackles being cut, abraded, or failing. The only full failure I found from damage to a soft shackle was [this incident from 2015](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/12EnhXc1Phb/). An overhand style soft shackle was entirely cut through by a sharp metal plate on a Balance Community AWL 3 while longlining. In addition to this full failure, there have been a number of reports of damaged soft shackles, most commonly when used with soft releases. I have personally had a brand new soft shackle significantly burned when it was used on the eye side of a soft release on a 1.1 km line. While this kind of damage is more common with very high tension (or high energy) lines, it does seem that damage to soft shackles from soft releases isn't entirely uncommon. Given the reports of potential failures, it is important to know how to inspect a soft shackle for the risk of accidental opening and for any damage to the dyneema.

## Inspecting Soft Shackles

### Noose Size
- can't see through the hole while its set
- fits about 3 strands of material
- must be inspected when leg lengths are equal
- have to be cautious of making them too small, which can prevent legs from sharing laod

### Button Knot
- tied correctly
	- four strands 90 degrees to each other on top
		- there is a common error where you will see 6 strands on top
		- This is likely to make the soft shackle deform over time
		- not necessarily a risk in the moment, but something to be wary of over time or in high load situations
- set correctly

### Dyneema in Good Condition
- burnt dyneema from soft release
- samson abrasion guide 
- know where to use soft shackles-can't be covered here, but very important to know
