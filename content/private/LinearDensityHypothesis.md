# The Linear Density Hypothesis

measured in g/m
how does the backup interact? 
	adds its weight at each tape
	dampens between tapes
What is most notable is large increases in the linear density
	backup wrapped around the line - if main and backup are the same weight, more than doubles the linear density
	splits
What is important is not just reducing the linear the density, but also increasing the dampening at locations of increased linear density (i.e. not adding small tapes by connectors, not letting the backup accumulate twists)
