# How to Tie Off Anything
Tail tie offs have been a part of highline rigging for decades, if not since the first line. Originally, they just involved clipping the tails of the webbing back to somewhere on the anchor. Sometime around 2015, as weblocks started slipping in the newly sagged lines, the munter mule overhand (MMO) method became popular, but was soon to be replaced by modern tie offs around 2018.

I am going to argue that there is exactly one good tie off. I'll discuss some minor variations, and way which aspects are more or less flexible, but overall I think every tie off should look almost exactly the same.

## What makes a good tie off?
### Secure
### Strong
### Reduce slippage
### Inspectable
### Releasable 
This is mentioned last because it is more important that a tie off save you than that it is releasable at the end of the day. But in practice, every tie off should be releasable. If your weblock slips, your tie off takes the whole tension of the line. If you want to release this tension without a knife, the tie off must have some way of releasing that tension. The most common way to do this is with some form of slippable knot, that is a knot finished with a bite.
