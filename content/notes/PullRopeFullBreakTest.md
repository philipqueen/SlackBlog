# Complete 6mm Pull Rope Double Braid Breaktests 

## Main Test 

Below are the full 65 break tests of [SGT Knots 6mm Double Braid Pull Rope](https://sgtknots.com/products/double-braided-polyester-pulling-rope). The tests were done on Balance Community's break test machine, reading at 500 Hz, which Jerry Miszewski generously let us use for testing. Samples were between 2 and 3 meters long, and had a figure 8 knot terminating any end not being tested (on both sides for the bend tests, on one side for the device tests). 

The cord in this test was about 1 year old and moderately used, although it showed a decent amount of wear on its sheath. Offcuts with notable abrasion spots were avoided where possible, although there was likely significant variation in wear across different test samples. The cord was broken because it had snapped in a progress capture during the tagging of the US Mile record attempt. It was donated by Vova Kozlov to allow testing for future projects and a better understanding of the failure during the mile tagging.
