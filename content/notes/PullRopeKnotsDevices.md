# Testing Pull Rope 6mm Double Braid Polyester Cord in Knots and Devices

## Introduction 

[Double Braid 6mm Pull Rope from SGT Knots](https://sgtknots.com/products/double-braided-polyester-pulling-rope) is a high strength and relatively inexpensive tagline that has been used as the final tagline for a number of 500m+ projects in the US over the past few years. It is rated for 2700 lbs (12 kN) and costs roughly $220 for 375m of tag. One of its main advantages is it comes with spliced ends, commonly believed to be full strength, which negates the strength reduction due to knots that other taglines suffer from.

The tagline is the subject of current interest because it recently snapped in a progress capture during the Paradise Highline Community mile long US record attempt (more about the failure below). Although it is quite strong, its practical limit was found in its performance in progress capture devices. This testing has been performed in order to provide reliable data on the breaking strength of this cord in the widest variety of progress capture devices possible, along with common knots. Hopefully this will provide better information for planning and on site decision making for big rigs, as well as facilitate better failure analysis of the US mile project.

### Information on Pull Rope

Double Braid Pull Rope is significantly cheaper than 6mm cord, and is rated about 60% stronger (compared to 7.3 kN Maxim cord). There is no published weight for Pull Rope, although it is likely heavier than 6mm accessory cord. It comes with spliced eyes on both ends, which are commonly believed to be full strength despite there being no claim to that effect from the manufacturer. Because it is full polyester, it is also quite low stretch. It has been seen as a great tagline for large projects due to it's low cost, high strength, and suitability for use in powered winches. 

### Tagline Failure at US Mile Project

During the Paradise Highlines US Mile (1670m) attempt, the Double Braid Pull Rope snapped while pulling the webbing across. At the time, there was roughly 1200m of Slacktivity Y2K in the gap. On the static side, the Pull Rope went through a kootenay pulley, then a Petzl Mini Traxion, before going into a gas powered winch. During the hold which preceded the failure, a Micro Traxion had been added between the Mini Trax and the winch but was not yet holding tension. The Mini Traxion was intended to be a backup in case the winch slipped, and in order to pass the soft shackle connections between sections of Pull Rope, a pulley system attached to two in-line handled ascenders was used to get the soft shackles from in front of the Mini Traxion to behind the winch.

During holds, the winch engine was having difficulty turning over with so much tension on the line (estimated at up to 4kN depending on the wind). As a solution, the static side team decided to remove wraps from the winch (from 4 wraps to 2), releasing tension onto the Mini Traxion. This is very dangerous, as [this report of a winch incident](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slackchat/permalink/6791126417627844/) indicates, but was the solution that the team decided on during the rig. They had performed this operation succesfully on an earlier hold, but at the time of the incident, as soon as wraps were removed from the winch the tagline snapped at the Mini Traxion, shooting violently out from the cliff, breaking a carabiner attached to the kootenay, and causing 1200m of webbing to drop into the trees below.

The system used was not ideal, and the failure could have been prevented with some small changes, like moving the backup progress capture to behind the winch or using a different method of reducing tension on the winch to help it turn over. However, it seems the system that was used was chosen because of the high strength rating of the Pull Rope, and a lack of awareness about the limitations of progress capture devices. Hopefully, this testing will shed light on the forces involved during the actual incident, and help provide useful data on the strength of used Pull Rope in devices.

## Testing Details

This testing was performed using Balance Community's break test machine taking readings at 500 Hz. Tests were performed by Philip Queen, Ana Lincoln, and Logan Henning. Tests were performed on roughly 2m long segments of Pull Rope, and were terminated on one end in a figure eight unless otherwise mentioned.

This testing would not have been possible without the generous donation of the remainder of the snapped section of pull rope by Vova Kozlov. 

## Interpretation

Capstan and spliced eye values are both weaker than expected, with a capstan to capstan value of 6.79 kN, instead of the 12 kN rating, and a spliced eye value of 5.46 kN. Lower than expected capstan values likely indicate the cord was significantly worn, while low spliced eye values likely indicate the spliced eyes were never full strength.
