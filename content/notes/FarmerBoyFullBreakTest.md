# Complete Farmer Boy Diamond Braid Breaktests 

## Main Test 

Below are the full 40 break tests of [Farmer Boy 5mm diamond braid polyester cord](https://farmerboyag.com/unicord-diamond-braid-rope-3-16-in-dia-x-1000-ft-l-polyester/). All tests were measured with a LineScale 2 on Peak Fast mode, with soft shackles connecting directly to the dynamometer. Tension was pulled by a single person per test on a 15:1 pulley system with 3" SMC pulleys. Samples were between 2 and 3 meters long. 

The cord in this test was about 2 years old and heavily used. Offcuts with notable abrasion spots were avoided where possible, although there was likely significant variation in wear across different test samples. The cord was broken because it was deemed due for retirement, and so represents conservative strength values for used cord.

## Other Known Testing - Alonso's Test Videos
Alonso's Figure 8 tests show values as high as 3.10 kN for 5mm diamond braid, indicating either that he was using a different brand of cord, or that his cord was less used than mine. My best guess is that my cord was simply more used than his. In the devices tested, our results are roughly similar, with minimum values with about .1 kN, or about 5%, across tests.

His tests are spread out across two videos, both below. The first breaks 5mm and 6mm diamond braid in a Petzl Micro Trax and Pro Trax, and the second breaks the same cords in the CT Roll N Lock as well as a figure 8.
