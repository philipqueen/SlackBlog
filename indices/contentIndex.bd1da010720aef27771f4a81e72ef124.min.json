The line was named \"Absurdian\", and while more reports will follow this, here's my accounting of the project by the numbers.\n\nThe line length was estimated at 3042m.\n\n\nWe were on sight for 10 days, and 6 of those days were spent rigging or derigging. \n\n\nWe had 33 pieces segments of webbing, and over 90 double wrapped 3mm sk99 grogs in the system.\n\n\nThe static anchor was two large boulder wraps with redundant spanset chains, combined with two sets of three ground plates, each tied with a 3 point bfk. These joined together, passed through a redirect bolt, and connected to two 8mm whoopies going to double rings on the hang point. There were two more ground stakes on each side, with the inner two connected with a bfk to the rings, and the outer two connected with whoopies. These side plates were there to stabilize the a frame and ensure we didn’t overload one leg of it. The hang point also had a stabilizer bolt directly below it.\n\n\nThe home anchor was four glue in bolts and two ground plates. The ground plates were necessary to make sure we had good anchor spread, and because it was hard to evaluate the size of the rock we were bolting into. The two ground plates and two outer bolts were each stabilized with a sliding x with limiting knots in spansets, and then each of those sliding xs were equalized with the inner two bolts (which were in larger rock) with another two sliding x with limiter knots. These two sliding xs were then extended with a spanset on each one, and connected together with a spanset quad. Two 8mm whoopies came off the spanset quad to the two rings on the hang point, and the rings were stabilized with two stabilizer bolts.\n\n\nWe tensioned the curtain up to 5 kN before sending webbing. We tensioned it on two equalized double Blake’s hitches, and let it sit with 5 wraps in a lynx 4 with a double Blake’s hitch behind on one side, and a double Blake’s hitch with a clutch and then a figure 8 descender behind on the other.\n\n\nSending the webbing over took about 5 hours, from 8:00 to 1:00. Cary got on the line to clean it at 2:20, and the line was unclipped and had the first crossing done by 5:16.\n\n\nWe originally put 7.2 pretension on the line, and sessioned with pretension between 6 and 7.5 without wind.\n\n\nIn total, we had 1 send by Danny Schlitt, an additional 3 crossings, and 7 more who got on the line. We had 32 people total on site throughout the week, with 22 on site the majority of the time. \n\n\nEmile was roughly halfway across the line at 11:00 when the wind picked up and he called for a rescue. The line got up to 17.8 kN with 22mph gusts recorded at the adjacent weather station. He had tensioned it to 7.5 just before getting on.\n\nAfter his rescue while the line was empty, tension got up to 19.2 with 24mph recorded gusts. We started releasing tension by 2:30, and with high winds keeping the line pinned hundreds of meters to the side, we emergency derigged. We got back to camp with all of the webbing, but not all of the curtain, by 7:30, roughly 36 hours after starting to send webbing across.","lastmodified":"2025-03-30T19:11:21.132593701Z","tags":null},"/notes/ChoiceOfSplitConnections":{"title":"Factors Influencing Choice of Split Connections","content":"\n# Factors Influencing Choice of Split Connections\n\nThere are many ways of making split connections on highlines, with no single method clearly considered \"best\" by the community. This post aims to give a general rubric for evaluating the safety and suitability of split connections for your rig, and provides a framework for inspecting new methods as they are theorized. Safety related factors are given first, and receive the bulk of the discussion, followed by a short section on convenience factors. Choosing the proper split design is an important way to maximize the safety benefits of connected highlines while minimizing the risk of additional failure points.\n\nAlso included in the post are top and side views of most of the popular split setups for reference. \n\n![\"Through-all-four\" connection with two grogs, shown in the field](notes/images/grogsplit1.jpeg)\n\n## Safety Related Factors\n\n### Strength\n\nHow strong does a connector in a highline split need to be? \n\nThe first answer is as strong as any expected force, plus a safety factor. On a shorter highline, that max expected force should be about 7 kN. I have measured this with a heavier person taking a leashfall on a 50m nylon line, and while slightly longer lines rigged correctly can mitigate this force, I still believe 7 kN is a good calculation starting point for highline forces. That would give a minimum connector strength of 21 kN with a 3:1 safety factor, and of 28 kN with a 4:1 safety factor. These values are right in line with the webbing strengths of most nylon and high stretch polyester webbings commonly used on shorter highlines. Keep in mind that we're interested in the strength of the connector in the configuration it will be used in so an aluminum carabiner, for example, rated to 21 kN, is not suitable because it will not be 21 kN once triloaded between two sewn loops. \n\nWhat happens as lines get longer? The highest forces recorded on very large highlines are around 20 kN in wind (the Asbestos 1.9 km reached 20.5 kN peak force, and the Norway 2.8km reached 19.5 kN peak force), and it is clear a 21 kN connector will no longer suffice. But achieving even a 3:1 safety factor then requires a 60kN connector, which is unnecessary when most high tech webbings used in these big lines break between 30 and 35 kN in a sewn loop. This motivates the more general recommendation that your connector in a split system should be as strong as the strength of the webbing it is attached to in a sewn loop. \n\n![\"The Cursive W\" split system - side view](notes/images/cursiveWside.jpg)\n![\"The Cursive W\" split system - top view](notes/images/cursiveWtop.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe \"Cursive W\" split system with two soft shackles. Structurally, this is very similar to \"the W\" shown below, but the long soft shackle crosses back and forth to connect to all of the loops. The 5mm soft shackles shown here are each ~45+ kN, and are suitably strong for split connections. The double wrapped soft shackle connecting the main loops should be twice that strength. \u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\nA connector with a strength in the low-to-mid 30s should be sufficient for almost all highline webbings on the market now. 5mm button knot soft shackles, 5mm grog slings doubled, 4mm button knot soft shackles doubled, and most 8mm quicklinks will have a strength ~35+kN. Some heavier nylon and polyester webbings or older high tech webbings have strengths of above 40kN, and it is likely that the next generation of high tech webbings will be stronger, so there may be an incentive for stronger connectors for some users.\n\nIn some split setups, two connectors can be used in such a way that they share load. In theory, you can add the two connectors' strengths together if the load is perfectly shared, but in order to preserve redundancy, each connector should be strong enough on its own. \n\n\n### Redundancies\n\nSplit highlines offer major safety advantages over traditional single strand highlines, but require paying much closer attention to redundancy. Between the anchors, a traditional highline requires one redundancy: A backup in case the mainline fails. Split highlines, however, have many required redundancies that can depend on the system used: What if one mainline fails? What if the other mainline fails? What if both fail? What if a connector fails? \n\nWhen presented with a new split system, it can be hard to go through every possible failure mode. A typical test is to pull (with your hands) on both mainlines, then both backups, then each separate combination of main and backup, and make sure each can correctly oppose force and loads the connectors well. \n\nThe pull test ensures redundancy of your webbing, but it's also important to test the redundancy in your connection. When doing the pull test, pay attention to which connectors are loaded in which situation, and how they are loaded. It's a good idea to remove one of your connectors and see what happens when you repeat the pull test. Once you're satisfied that that connector is redundant, put the split back together and remove the other connector. \n\nThis may seem like a lot to test, but redundancy has prevented countless highline accidents from becoming serious or fatal. Remember that the key to redundancy is that any one part of the system can fail without the whole system failing. What does it mean for the system to fail? It may mean different things depending on the situation, like on a low midline, where the backup may be intact, but the system failed if a backup fall led to the slackliner hitting the deck. \n\n### Prevention of Cascading Failure\n\nAny split connection should prevent cascading failures as much as possible. A **cascading failure** occurs when the failure of one component leads to other components failing. \n\n![Double soft shackle Inov Split - side view](notes/images/ssInovSide.jpg) ![Double soft shackle Inov Split - top view](notes/images/ssInovTop.jpg)   \n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe \"Inov Split\" split system with two soft shackles. The knots of the soft shackles are tucked inside the sewn loops. In the classic Inov Split, the center soft shackle connecting the two backups is replaced by a quicklink. If the \"S\" shaped soft shackle were to fail, both mains would be out of the system leading to a double backup fall.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\nAn example of a split connection with cascading failures is the the classic Inov Split, where a soft shackle connects both mainlines in a figure eight pattern, and a quicklink or soft shackle connects both backups to the crossing strands of the main soft shackle. The system is fully redundant, because no single piece failing leads to failure of the whole system. However, because the backup loops are not connected directly to the opposing side main loops, the system is set up for a cascading failure in the case of main soft shackle failure. If the main soft shackle fails, the line drops onto two backup segments, which is equivalent to both main segments failing. The failure of the main soft shackle cascades through to the segments it was connecting, resulting in a large fall.\n\n![2 through 4 with two soft shackles - side view](notes/images/2through4side.jpg)                                                                                                                                                                                                   ![2 through 4 with two soft shackles - sidetop view](notes/images/2through4top.jpg)                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe \"through-all-four\" or \"two-through-four\" split system with two soft shackles. The knots of the soft shackles are tucked in the gap between the loops. The backups are tucked inside the main loops to act as thimbles, and are tucked from opposite sides to prevent rolling.\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nTo see how this is avoidable, consider the \"through-all-four\" split system, where two soft shackles each go through all four (two main, two backup) sewn loops, often with the backup loops stacked inside the main loops. Both soft shackles share load, and connect to the same points in the system. Now if one soft shackle fails, nothing else in the system is affected. We have lost redundancy at the split, but nothing else has failed. Importantly, a large fall has been avoided, and redundancy has been preserved across both segments. \n\nAt its worst, a cascading failure means that one component failing leads to the whole system failing. Proper redundancy prevents this by ensuring that any one component of the system can fail without the system failing. But even with full redundancy, a cascading failure can turn a small mistake into a big mistake. Not only is falling onto two backup segments a serious risk of groundfall on many lines, but it now requires a rescue off of a line with two segments worth of lost redundancy. Cascading failures generally come with a cascading loss of redundancy, and in the conditions that are most likely to cause highline failures (adverse weather and user error), you want all of the redundancy you can get. Remember, most major accidents are the result of multiple bad decisions - do your best to insulate your bad decisions from each other.\n\n### Security\n\nThe security of a split connection refers to how securely attached the different webbing segments are. Can the connectors shake open under vibration, or be unintentionally opened if stepped on or hit during a leashfall? We all know a forged metal leash ring is a secure attachment for our leash to the webbing, but a carabiner is not. How do we evaluate the security of our different connection systems?\n\nQuicklinks are often thought to be the most secure connection method, perhaps due to the psychological effect of having a solid piece of metal in the system. But quicklinks are not a solid piece of metal. If a quicklink is not fully screwed shut, it can fail much lower than its rated force. It is best to think of a quicklink as being only as secure as the last turn of its closure. **If using quicklinks in split connections, always use a wrench to tighten them.** Even then, quicklinks have been known to fail on split connections due to the vibration of an extreme wind event. Some people will tape the closure of their quicklinks shut after wrench-tightening them to help prevent movement from vibration.\n\nSoft shackles are often seen as a less secure option for connections compared to quicklinks, but there are no documented cases of soft shackles opening when used in a split connection ([If you know of any, please file a SAIR report through the ISA](https://data.slacklineinternational.org/safety/report-incident/english/)). Like quicklinks, they can be taped shut by applying a small amount of tape at the noose. The most secure method for using soft shackles is most likely just keeping all soft shackles under tension, which can be achieved by a \"through-all-four system.\" Some people employ one of two different varieties of \"locking soft shackles,\" where either the noose or the knot is passed through the legs of the soft shackle before putting the noose over the knot, but it is unclear if there's any advantage to this method. \n\n![\"Through-all-four\" system with two grog splices - side view](notes/images/2grogsSide.jpg)                                  ![\"Through-all-four\" system with two grog splices - top view](notes/images/2grogsTop.jpg)                                    \n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGrog splices used in a \"through all 4\" split system instead of soft shackles. Note the significantly reduced side profile. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[Grog splices](notes/GrogSplices.md) appear to offer the best in security, as they are connected with a brummel splice, although more real world use is needed to confirm this. As they become more commonly used, we will know better if this reasoning is correct. Lock stitching the tail buries can make them almost perfectly secure, at the cost of more time connecting and disconnecting. \n  \n### Minimization of Movement\n\nMovement in a split connection can't be fully avoided due to the dynamic nature of highlines, and it has been responsible for a numbers of failures on split highlines. Regular movement of the highline can cause a back and forth sawing motion that allows twisted backups, especially those made up of round dyneema backup extenders, to abrade into the mainline. High wind has caused multiple types of split failures, including shaking open quicklinks and causing a soft shackle to be cut by the webbing in a DLV (Dura-La-Vida) connection. During a backup fall, the rapid shift of tension has potential to create a significant amount of heat if there is movement within the split, as there is in many connection styles. We can't fully avoid movement in our highlines: in the case of wind and backup falls, we try our best to avoid them but can't guarantee that we will, and regular movement of the highline is a core part of why we highline. The best we can do is mitigate its effects by choosing good split setups.\n\nSplit setups should be chosen to avoid the potential for movement related failure modes like cutting, abrasion, and heat (vibration is another failure mode that is mostly an issue for quicklinks). The first step is to decrease the potential for explosive shifts during backup falls, as the fast shifts create potential for cutting and abrasion and can generate significant heat. Ideally, there is no difference in how the connectors are loaded during normal use vs during a backup fall. The Y2K system is a good example of very limited movement because as long as the backup connector is small enough, the two backup loops do not have the ability to move in the connection. The classic Inov Split has too much movement: because the backup connector is attached to a sliding x on a soft shackle, whichever mainline breaks is going to cause a shift in both the main soft shackle and the backup connector. \n\n![\"Dura La Vida\" split connection with quicklinks - side view](notes/images/DuraLaVidaSide.jpg)                                  \n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003e\"Dura La Vida\" connection with two quicklinks. Note the gap in the sewing on the right that allows significant back and forth motion. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nBeyond just explosive movements during a backup fall, splits should minimize the possible movement in its \"standard\" configuration as well. The \"through-all-four\" split is the best at minimizing movement. Because everything in the split shares tension, there is little potential for extraneous movement. The shared tension also prevents explosive movements in a backup fall. The DLV split is particularly bad at minimizing movement due to its large size, required by the sewing. This extra space allows the connector to move back and forth freely, which is what caused the webbing in a DLV to cut the soft shackle in the incident mentioned above. Although this incident happened in heavy wind, it's possible for the same effect to happen during a backup fall. While quicklinks would not be cut by the webbing in these scenarios, it's possible for the quicklink to cut the webbing if it has any sharp edges, which is especially likely if the quicklink has partially opened.\n\n### Ease of Inspection\n\n\n![\"The W\" split connection method - side view](notes/images/theWside.jpg)\n![\"The W\" split connection method - top view](notes/images/theWtop.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003e\"The W\" split system with two soft shackles. \"The W\" allows offsetting the sewn loops by using a longer backup connector. The main connector soft shackle is doubled wrapped here to keep the loops close together. This split setup is not complicated once you know it, but is relatively hard to inspect when you see it the first time. \u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\nFollowing the tips discussed above will help you decide on a safe highline split setup. None of them, however, are foolproof against human error, and human error is the leading cause of fatal accidents in highlining. Making your splits easy to inspect will help you and anyone you rig with catch potentially catastrophic errors. Simple splits are easier to inspect, especially for people unfamiliar with your method of making connections. It should be easy to tell that both of your backups are connected to both mains and to see that each connector is going through the proper loop. Splits covered in sleeves or excessive tape can be difficult or impossible to inspect, and have a high potential for uncaught human error. For example, if you have taped a quicklink shut, it is no longer easy to tell if it has been wrenched closed without undoing the tape (if it is still easy to tell, the tape is not doing anything).\n\n![\"The W\" split connection method opened up - top view](notes/images/theWopenedTop.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003e\"The W\" split system with two soft shackles, opened to show its structure. The doubled soft shackle goes through both main loops, and the long backup shackle goes through all four loops. It is easy to inspect when laid out like this, although in practice it is normally taped up so this view cannot be seen. When making the W, it is best to construct it like this with both backups upside down, and then fold the backups towards the main to make the right-side up. This gives the backup shackle its \"W\" shape and keeps your webbing flat.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n  \n\n---\n\n\n## Use and Convenience Related Factors\n\n### Bulk\n\nSplits can add significant bulk to the otherwise continuous 1\" wide highlines we walk, which can catch your leashring while you walk, interrupting your flow and possibly your send. While a caught sewn loop while walking can be annoying, big splits also make rescues significantly more difficult and time consuming. While a Kootenay (knot passing pulley) can help mitigate this, they're rarely found at most rigs and still can be needlessly caught by a large split. Rescues are already a very time sensitive maneuver, and a large split only reduces your chance of a successful outcome. Large splits are also difficult to pass through z-drags, and trying to force a split through a z-drag while under tension can easily lead to injury. \n\nIn the past 2 years, slackline companies have started to make large (~3\" inner diameter) aluminum leashrings specifically designed to make walking past splits easier. However, even with big leashrings you can get snagged on an overly bulky split. With older style leashrings, a poorly made split can be almost impossible to pass. Keeping your splits slim in both directions perpendicular to the webbing will help your leashrings glide smoothly past while you walk. It's also important to setup your split so there are no protruding pieces to catch a ring, which can include tucking button knots inside the sewn loops or inverting the shackle so they point inwards, taping your backup loops to the main so the stiff stitching can't protrude, and taping the tab at the end of the stitching on both main and backup loops.\n\n### Weight\n\nSplits are generally significantly heavier than the webbing around them, which makes walking harder by changing the line dynamics and makes your whole rig heavier to carry. Heavy metal in a split can also seriously injure someone if they fall right at the split. Steel leashrings have been known to hit people in the face, breaking teeth and noses, and quicklinks in a split are just as capable of hurting someone in a fall. \n\nThe ideal split has the exact linear density, or weight per meter, of your main and backup webbing together. It is likely better to be too light than too heavy. Calculating this can be very difficult, as it requires knowing the exact weight of your sewn loops, and will differ across different webbings. It is useful as an ideal because it can help explain why saving a few dozen grams in your pack weight might not matter much, but saving that same weight out of your line might make a huge difference in how your line feels to walk.\n\n### Ease of Setup/Takedown\n\nIf you are connecting and disconnecting different webbings on site, it is beneficial to have connections that are fast and easy to make and take apart. Even if you've connected your webbing beforehand, you may end up changing them on site if you made a mistake like swapping the main and backup on a segment. Soft shackles are the easiest connector to do and undo, because they do not need a special tool to use. Both quicklinks and grog splices need special tools to make a connection (a wrench and a fid, respectively), and quicklinks will also need a tool to undo. While grogs are still relatively quick to connect (see [splicing grogs on site](notes/SplicingGrogsOnSite.md)), they won't be if you're trying to makeshift a tool at the anchor. In addition to your connectors, it is important you are familiar with your split style and have practice making it. Trying to remember which connector goes where while stressed at the anchor is not ideal for a few reasons, speed only being one of them.\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhen evaluating a method of connecting split highlines, ensure your chosen method is:\n\n- Strong \n- Redundant\n- Prevents cascading failures\n- Secure\n- Minimizes movement\n- Easily inspectable\n\nOnce all these criteria are met, convenience factors like bulk, weight, and ease of setup and takedown can differentiate between competing options. \n\nSplit connections have significant safety advantages over continuous highlines across a range of different scenarios, but also add risk of high-consequence failures. Carefully constructing and inspecting whichever split you choose is vital for having a safe rig.","lastmodified":"2025-03-30T19:11:21.132593701Z","tags":null},"/notes/DoubleWrappedGrogs":{"title":"Double Wrapped Grogs","content":"\n# Double Wrapped Grog Splices\n\n![Clayton's 5mm Double Wrap Grogs](notes/images/ClaytonGrog2.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eA double wrapped 5mm grog connection made and photographed by Clayton Underwood. Double wrapped grogs are a very strong connector. The pictured connector is as strong as, smaller than, and half the weight of a 5mm soft shackle connection. Note: the tail bury on the right side of the picture should start closer to the brummel splice.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\nDouble wrapping grogs was the first major change to using the infinite loops in highline splits. As far as I know, Jerry Miszewski was the first to rig a line on double wrapped 5mm grogs. It was a natural development, as the highliners interested in light and small connections were already double wrapping 4mm soft shackles to reduce the size of the button knots. It also allowed for a smaller gap between sewn loops, since the grogs have a minimum length that was not short enough for some people's taste. The doubled grogs were good enough that almost every split line at GGBY 2022 were rigged on two double wrapped 5mm grogs in a \"2 through 4\" style system. \n\nThis articles goes over the advantages and disadvantages of double wrapped grogs, tips for splicing them, and the breaking strength of 4mm and 5mm double wrapped grogs. There are also some additional breaktests covering questions that were brought up by the original post about grogs.\n\n\n### Update: Usage\n\nIn general, one double wrapped grog should replace one connector: a single wrapped grog, a soft shackle, a double wrapped soft shackle, or a quicklink. In a \"2 through 4\" system that means two double wrapped grogs through all four sewn loops. But in different split designs, for example y2k splits, it means one double wrapped grog through both main loops, and a separate double wrapped grog through the backup loops and sewn connections to the main.\n\nThe original version of this article was apparently often read to be implying one double wrapped grog could substitute two single wrapped grogs, and thus that double wrapped grogs do not need to be redundant. This was not intended and is not my recommendation. The examples from real rigs in this post are all two double wrapped 5mm grogs, and the split system I am recommending is a \"2 through 4\" system with **two** double wrapped 4mm grogs.\n\nThere is no replacement for redundancy, especially in the main load path of a highline. \n\n### Benefits of double wrapping\n\nThere are a few benefits of double wrapping grogs:\n1. *Strength*\nDouble wrapping a connector makes it twice as strong. This makes grogs stronger than almost any webbing, and stronger than a comparable soft shackle (while still being half as light).\n2. *Connection length*\nSome people value a very short connection, and try to get their sewn loops as close as possible. Double wrapped grogs allow you to have sewn loops that almost touch. This also avoids the potential of getting a finger or toe caught in the gap that single wrapped grogs leave.\n3. *Ability to use smaller diameter dyneema*\nBecause double wrapping doubles the strength of the grog, it makes double wrapped 4mm grogs a viable alternative to 5mm grogs (see breaktesting below). This reduces weight and counteracts the additional bulk of the double wrap.\n\n![Clayton's 5mm Double Wrap Grogs](notes/images/ClaytonGrog1.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eAnother view of Clayton's double wrapped 5mm grogs under tension. \u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n### Downsides of double wrapping\n\nThere are a few downsides to double wrapping grogs, although if you're not splicing them onsite, the downsides are quite minimal.\n1. *Harder to splice*\nDouble wrapped grogs are harder to splice in the sense that it takes longer and requires more dexterity. The brummel is the same, but because the grog is tighter to the sewn loops, making the bury is more difficult. There are tips below on how to make splicing double wrapped grogs easier.\n2. *Bulkier*\nThe same thing that makes double wrapped grogs stronger and brings the loops close together, also adds bulk to the split. There are twice as many strands fitting in the same cross section, so they take up more room. But, a double wrapped grog is still the same size as a soft shackle of the same diameter, *without the button knot*. Using 4mm double wrapped grogs also helps mitigate this, and is still an extremely sleek connection.\n3. *Increased linear density*\nDouble wrapping grogs does not increase the total weight of your split compared to single wrapping them. But it does increase the density of your split by halving the distance that its weight is spread over. This can make the line harder to walk, as there is a more pronounced weight difference compared to the rest of the line. However, the weight density is still less than a soft shackle, and the total weight of doubled wrapped 4mm grogs is lighter than any other connector.\n\n![Clayton's 5mm Double Wrap Grogs](notes/images/ClaytonGrog3.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eAnother view of Clayton's 5mm double wrapped grogs under tension, showing how small the connection size is.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n## Tips on making double wrapped grogs\n\nAt first thought, doubled wrapped grogs seem very hard to make. They are too tight of a loop to pass a normal fid through, so how do you bury the tails? In reality, they're not much harder than a normal grog if you know the method, so follow the tips below to make splicing your double wrapped grogs easier.\n1. Use a longer piece of amsteel\nFor double wrapped grogs, use a 23\" piece of amsteel instead of a 20\" piece. The bury lengths should still be 4\", but the extra space allows the sewn loops to just fit in place.\n2. Bunch all of the loops together\nOnce the dyneema is threaded through all of the loops, bunch them together on side to give yourself room to work.\n3. Pull the ends tight before making the brummel\nPull both ends of the dyneema so that the middle loop of amsteel is tight against the sewn loops. This gives you as much of the tails to work with as possible.\n4. Bury the tails in sections\nEven with the above tips, there is not enough space to have a straight length of amsteel long enough to bury all of the tails. By burying each tail in two or three short passes of the fid, you can have a very tight connection.\n\nAlso, be sure to add [webbing thimbles](https://aki-slacklines.de/en/blog/break-loads-of-sewn-slackline-loops-in-combination-with-soft-shackles) when using soft connectors on sewn loops. The small loop size of double wrapped grogs makes this even more important.\n\n## Breaktests\nDisclaimer: the breaktests were performed at the Balance Community workshop using their breaktest machine, and with the assistance of Balance Community founder Jerry Miszewski. \nSee the full breaktests at [the complete breaktest page](notes/GrogSpliceFullBreakTest) (some additional testing data is also included there).

On one side of the grog, there is a clear hole visible where the dyneema is spliced through, and I recommend splicing directly into the clear hole. On the other side, no clear hole is visible, so I recommend splicing at the pick (\"V\" in the dyneema braid) closest to the brummel. \n\nI was told that some people pull the brummel back all the way until they expose the hole in the other side of the brummel, and splice through there. Thus, both tails are spliced directly into a hole made by the brummel, rather than one side entering the weave from the side. I tested 3 grogs made like this, and saw no strength benefits to intentionally going through both holes. The benefit is a reproducible method, but my recommended method of choosing the closest pick to the brummel that's clearly visible has shown to be reproducible with respect to strength.\n\n| Number of Samples | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN) |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 3  | 29.41 | 27.8 | \n\n\n### Endura Grogs\nOne concern when I published my original post on blog was that the strength of a grog with a given bury length would vary significantly with different types of UHMWPE. I was able to test 3 grogs made of New England Ropes Endura 12, which is a variant of SK-75 with a special marine coating. It has a noticeably different feel in hand that Amsteel Blue, which is SK-78 and has a proprietary Samthane coating. The Endura 12 grogs had two very high results, and one that is near the lower end of standard Amsteel grogs. There seems to be no downside in using Endura 12 instead of Amsteel Blue. \n\n| Number of Samples | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN) |\n|:-----------------:|:---------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n|         3         |            35.7             |           28.6            |\n\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile grogs were already the smallest and lightest connection, double wrapping them can lead to an even smaller and lighter connection. Double wrapped 4mm grogs are extremely light, and take up very little space. I have not had a chance to walk on them yet, but given how good double wrapped 5mm grogs feel, I'm sure they making walking past splits even nicer. And at over 40 kN strong, they are stronger than most webbings.\n\n![3mm grog made from D12 99 MAX](notes/images/3mmgrog.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eA 3(!)mm double wrapped grog on a single sewn loop to sewn loop connection, with soft thimbles.

Unlike trad anchors that require specialized gear, boulder wraps can be done with just spansets or rope. This makes them an accessible anchor to build with respect to the gear needed, but it is very hard to learn how to tell if a given boulder is safe to rig to. It takes dedicated mentorship that can be difficult to find, especially in areas where boulder anchors aren't very common. The few discussions about the topic on [SlackChat](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/188dVVm8fo/)  have at least as much bragging about what people have gotten away with as there is good information.\n\nThe goal of this post is to cover the details of evaluating a boulder for highline rigging. I will focus on some simple physics and how to estimate a ballpark strength. The goal is not to be able to definitively say how strong a given anchor is, but rather to be able to better compare different anchors, and potentially rule out unsafe anchors. This article will not cover how to rig off of boulders. It will only help give a framework for deciding whether a given boulder is safe to rig off of. \n### Accidents\n\nThere have been a handful of high profile accidents that happened while rigging off of boulders. It is important to know about these, as they show the risk of boulder rigging and reveal common pitfalls. This [fatality in Brazil](https://docs.google.com/file/d/1x1BBiyLnfLe5zse-juDjmVod9RptQNUN/view) and the much more recent [close call in Mexico](https://data.slacklineinternational.org/publications/accident-reports/total_anchor_failure-el_salto_mexico_2024_v1_en.pdf/) are both well chronicled by the International Slackline Association (ISA). Both accidents involved anchoring to some type of bolt, the underlying issue in each case was the size of the block that was rigged to. There was also a near miss anchor failure that happened last year involving a slung boulder, that is worth discussing in detail. \n\n![Failed Boulder Anchor at Red Rocks](notes/images/RedRocksBoulder.jpeg)\n\nA few days into the Red Rocks Reacharound gathering in 2024, Michael was walking the 180m Blue line and had just crossed the halfway point when he fell for the third time that session. As he bounced in the leash, he heard a loud sound and felt himself drop. Looking up at the far anchor, he saw a cloud of dust. What he felt, heard, and saw were the effects of the boulder the line was anchored to falling off its resting place.\n\nThe boulder was roughly 1m x 2m x 4m (8m^3) in size, and had slid about a meter forward and a meter and a half down to lay tilting forward. It also had a few horns extending behind an adjacent larger rock that looked like they would help keep the boulder from moving, but were broken during the fall.\n\nLooking at it after the fact, it was clear the boulder had very little surface contact with the ground it was resting on, and the surface was sandy, fractured sandstone. This means there was very little friction to keep the boulder from moving. Also, the sandstone in the area was very weak, which led the horns that were seemingly keeping the boulder in place to break off. Luckily the boulder came to rest against another block in front of it, which helped prevent it from continuing to slide. Also, the new contact point between the boulder and the rock below was only about 1 foot away from crushing both spansets, which would likely have caused them to be cut and for the entire anchor to fail. During the actual fall there was 1 hole put in the sheath of a green spanset that did not reveal the core, and the other green spanset was unharmed. It appears very lucky that the rock shifted in such a way that the spansets were unharmed. It was also very lucky the rock didn’t fall far enough for it to break into multiple pieces, which also would have compromised the anchor.\n\n![Closeup of the boulder almost crushing the spansets](notes/images/RedRocksSpansetCloseup.jpeg)\n\nThe boulder, while quite large in 2 dimensions, was relatively thin, making it easy to overestimate its size. It was right on the edge of being the size of a small car, and may have been big enough in a different setting. What was obviously unacceptable was the contact point of the rock. The boulder had very little contact with the weak underlying rock, and the center of mass of the rock was probably very close to being off the base of support. This made it very likely that the anchor would fail over time. It’s possible there were a series of small, unnoticeable shifts in the anchor before it finally failed.\n\n![Bolted boulder, also in Red Rocks](notes/images/RedRocksBoltedBoulder.jpeg)\n\nAside from the near accident that occurred, there was also a very concerning boulder on the far side of a 70m line. Apparently this boulder had been slung in the past and participants had brought up safety concerns about its size. As a resolution, someone bolted the boulder itself thinking it was an improvement. Instead, what they did was replicate the failure mode of the Brazil fatality linked above. This line was barely used during the festival because word spread that the far anchor wasn't safe, and it was derigged after the 180m anchor boulder moved. The boulder itself is roughly half the size of the boulder that moved on the 180m, and has a similarly small contact patch. In the picture you can see a gap under the boulder that you can see all the way to the valley floor through. While the boulder is being pulled very slightly uphill, the center of mass appears to be above the edge of the cliff, and the bolts have the potential to cause a tipping or flipping motion. Unlike the boulder anchor for the 180m that had a very gentle slope in front of it with other boulders, this anchor has a sheer drop, and the boulder moving would be catastrophic for the line.  \n\nThese accidents and near misses demonstrate the risks of rigging to boulders, and the importance of evaluating your boulders well. Keep these lessons in mind while reading the rest of this post, and while rigging with boulders on your own.\n## Practical Evaluation\n\nWhen we're natural rigging, we never get an opportunity to know with certainty the strength of what we're rigging to. We don't have the opportunity to weigh the boulder we're using, measure the coefficient of friction between rocks, or find out how deep a tree's roots go into the soil.  The trick is to do our best to estimate the relevant factors with what limited information we have. The purpose of this section is to develop heuristics to help you estimate the unknowns, and develop a sense of the magnitude of our uncertainty. We will cover in precise formulas with imprecise inputs. As always in highlining, give yourself a large safety factor to mitigate risk.\n\n As a general rule of thumb, you shouldn't rig to a boulder smaller than the size of a small car, which is roughly 1.5x1.5x4 m, or 9 m^3. There have been a number of cases of refrigerator sized (roughly 1x1x2 m, or 2 m^3) boulders being pulled off a cliff by a highline. The size of a small car is a good minimum for most cases, but going into depth we'll see there are cases where it's insufficient, as well as cases where it's possible to get away with less. Beyond size, always take into account some estimate of density, friction, and slope to get a more complete picture.\n### Estimating Size\n\nSize is the easiest part of the equation to estimate with boulders. You figure out the best way to split it into three planes and estimate its length, width, and height. Multiply those together and you have the volume of the boulder, which can help you compare to other boulders you've rigged to in the past. As long as most of the boulder is visible, it's easy to do this without any tools. Find out roughly how big 1, 1.5, and 2 meters are on your body, and combine those measurements to estimate in the real world (waist high might mean 1m, two full arm spans might mean 3.5m). The issue is that most boulders aren't perfect rectangles, so calculating the actual volume can be tough. What do you do if part of the form is missing or protruding? It's best to be as conservative as possible, so choose the smaller edge when you have an option. Miscalculating a side can lead to very different results. For example, if you estimate a boulder to be 2x2x2m (8m^3) but it's actually 1.5x1.5x2m (4.5m^3), it's just above half the size of your estimate. Small errors get compounded while multiplying the edge lengths. Like the old saying to measure twice and cut once, look at the whole boulder and use the small perpendicular edges while calculating volume. \n### Estimating Density\n\nKnowing the size of your boulder is important, but not all rocks are the same density. The blocks at Stonehenge might support a slackline, but the full scale replica at [Foamhenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foamhenge) wouldn't. If you check a geology textbook, you'll find most rocks we rig off of have a density of around 2600 kg/m^3. A quick calculation makes this look very encouraging. A 2m^3 boulder, roughly the size of a refrigerator, would have a mass of around 5200 kg. Multiply that by the force of gravity (9.8m/s^2) and you get ~51kN of weight. It's then tempting to say it would take more than 50 kN to move the boulder, so it's fine to rig off of. But as mentioned above, refrigerator sized blocks have failed as highline anchors multiple times, so the picture must be more complicated than it seems.\n\n**Estimated Wet Bulk Density and Porosity by Rock Type:**\n\n| Rock Type | Low Density Estimate | High Density Estimate | Porosity Range |\n| --------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |\n| Granite   | 2500 kg/m^3          | 2800 kg/m^3           | 0.01 - 25%     |\n| Limestone | 2500 kg/m^3          | 2750 kg/m^3           | 1 - 25%        |\n| Sandstone | 2200 kg/m^3          | 2600 kg/m^3           | 5 - 30%        |\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eTable values and explanation of density and porosity from [Hydrogeologic Properties of Earth Materials and Principles of Groundwater Flow - The Groundwater Project](https://books.gw-project.org/hydrogeologic-properties-of-earth-materials-and-principles-of-groundwater-flow/chapter/total-porosity/). The porosity range for granite combines both \"fresh\" and \"weathered\" granite, which are separated in the source. The upstream source of this data is ThoughtCo, who does not cite their source - let me know if you find a more reliable source.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nThe density estimates typically found online, and listed in the table above, are given as **wet bulk density**. This is the weight of the rock *fully saturated with water* divided by its volume. Obviously we're not rigging off of fully saturated boulders, so what we're interested in is the **dry bulk density**, which is the density when the rock is filled with air. To find the dry bulk density from the wet bulk density, you need to multiply it by one minus the **porosity**, which is the percent of the volume of rock that is just air. The biggest thing to notice here is that within each type of rock there's huge variance in the porosity. A piece of granite and a piece of sandstone might have the same wet bulk density and be the same size, but the sandstone could weight 30% less. Similarly two pieces of granite might have the same wet bulk density and be the same size, but if one has been significantly more weathered it might have lost 25% of its weight over time. This means estimating off wet bulk density alone can get you up to a 30% error, but there's more limitations on our naive force estimation from before that we will cover in the next section.\n\nAs a heuristic for estimating density, you can pick up nearby rocks and see if they feel light or heavy for their size. A surprisingly light rock indicates your boulder is probably relatively porous, whereas a heavier than expected rock indicates your boulder is probably dense. If you go with this approach, try to make sure the rocks you are comparing against are as similar as possible to the boulder you are trying to rig off of. \n### Estimating Friction\n\nThe force required to move a stationary object on a flat plane is the weight times the coefficient of friction. A coefficient of friction of greater than 1 means that it will take more force than an object's weight to move it, and a coefficient of friction less than 1 means it will take less force than an objects weight to move it. In an ideal setting, the coefficient of friction is the same regardless of the size of the contact surface. So regardless of the size of the boulder or amount of contact it has with the ground, the weight and coefficient of friction should give us the force required to move the boulder. In a 1978 paper [Friction of Rocks](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/static/lfs/research/rockphysics/Friction_of_rocks.pdf) from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the author gives us a range to estimate the friction between two rocks: \"the coefficient of friction can be as low as 0.3 and as high as 10.\" However, the high values mentioned only show up in \"maximum friction\" after a \"stick-slip\" cycle. The values we're interested in are the \"initial friction\" values, which is the amount it takes to start moving. In the relevant graph, we see all the data points are below 0.85, which gives us a practical range of 0.3 - 0.85. Importantly the author says  \"there is no strong dependence of friction on rock type\", so this range will be constant across difference scenarios.\n\n![Initial friction between rocks graphed](notes/images/InitialFrictionGraph.png)\n\nAt the start of this section, I mentioned that in an ideal case the size of the contact surface doesn't affect the coefficient of friction. However, in the case of friction between rocks \"the large variation in friction is due to the variation of friction with surface roughness\". Surface roughness is one of the cases where the ideal model of friction breaks down. Because surface roughness is the major contributing factor, the size of contact patch matters a lot in considering how much friction a boulder has with the ground its resting on. Favor boulders with a lot of surface contact over boulders with little surface contact. A boulder with barely any surface contact could be as much as 3 times easier to move than a boulder with significant surface contact.\n\n### Factoring in Slope\n\nSo far we've considered size, density, and friction, but have assumed we're on a fully level surface. In reality, we're often working with sloped surfaces that will complicate the math. Everyone should already have the basic intuition for this scenario though: it is harder to pull something uphill, and easier to pull it downhill. To make this more rigorous, we can consider two different components of force, one parallel to angle of the slope and one perpendicular. The force with friction we calculated in the last section is perpendicular to the slope, and some trigonometry tells us we need to multiply the force of friction by the cosine of the angle of our slope. The parallel force doesn't have friction, so it's just the weight times the sine of the angle of our slope. If we treat downhill slopes as positive angles and uphill slopes as negative angles, we can subtract the parallel force from the perpendicular force to get the total. Because of the shape of sine and cosine waves, this effect will be very small with small uphill and downhill angles, but will become stronger very quickly as the angles increase. In the extreme uphill case, it would require lifting the boulder entirely off the ground to get it to move. In the extreme downhill case, the boulder would already be right on the edge of sliding downhill. \n### Center of Mass and Tipping Forces\n\nIn all the above we have also been assuming we are pulling the boulder right at its **center of mass**. However, as the accident report about the [fatality in Brazil](https://docs.google.com/file/d/1x1BBiyLnfLe5zse-juDjmVod9RptQNUN/view) describes well, it can be extremely important where you pull on a block or boulder. If you pull high above the center of mass, you can cause it to tip. If the rock is unstable, pulling too far below the center of mass could also cause the rock to tip (like knocking someone over by pushing on their knees). Generally though, it's better to err on the side rigging lower on a boulder and just avoiding boulders that are unstable. You want to find boulders with a wide base of support (more like a pyramid than an upside down pyramid) and pull at the center of mass or below. I have not done any mathematical modeling of this, it is just a demonstrated problem from reported accidents.\n\n## Full Calculation\n\nIf we put all of the above together, we get the following equation for the force required to move the boulder:\n\n`Force = Friction * (1 - porosity) * wet bulk density * gravity * volume * cos(slope) - (1 - porosity) * wet bulk density * gravity * volume * sin(slope)`\n\nOr to put it more simply, if `weight = (1 - porosity) * wet bulk density * gravity * volume`, then:\n\n`Force = Friction * weight * cos(slope) - weight * sin(slope)`\n\nTo fill in reasonable assumptions for the variables:\n- Friction: 0.3 - 0.85, depending on surface roughness\n- Porosity: 0.01 - 30%, depending on rock type\n- Wet Bulk Density: 2200 - 2800 kg/m^3, depending on rock type\n- Gravity: 9.8 m/s^2\n- Volume: calculate on your own in m^3\n- Slope: calculate on your own\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that this formula is limited. For one, we never have exact knowledge of all the variables, so at best we get an estimate of the force it would take to move the boulder. Also, the formula doesn't take into account the size of the contact surface or any tipping forces. There's also a lot that could change the behavior of the system, like the boulder being in contact with other boulders that might keep it from moving, a layer of dirt surrounding the base of the boulder, or even the boulder resting on a surface that isn't rock. Finally, there's other problems that could occur besides just the boulder moving. There's been at least one case of a boulder exploding from compression while being used as a highline anchor, so general rock quality, presence of cracks and seams, and internal structure all play important roles that aren't factored into this calculation. In light of this, always be conservative with your estimations and give yourself a large safety factor to help prevent fatal errors.\n\n### Comparisons\nThe value of this equation isn't in getting an exact number for the strength of the boulder. There's too much uncertainty in the variables and too much missing context for it to be able to do that. What it does allow is to do is compare the effect sizes of different variables and of our uncertainties. The rest of this section will provide comparisons within the ranges of variables in order to show how changes to the variables effect the strength of a boulder.\n\n**Friction**:\nUsing constants of 0.2 for porosity, 2600 kg/m^3 for wet bulk density, 8m^3 for volume, and 0 degrees for the slope, we can change the friction coefficient to see its effects. At the lower end of the friction range (0.3) we get 48.9 kN, which is just barely sufficient for an anchor if we've estimated everything correctly. With the max friction value we get 138.6 kN, just under 3 times stronger and much better as a choice for an anchor.\n\nUsing 10 degrees for the slope, we get a more pronounced effect. At a friction of 0.3, we get 19.9 kN. That is far too weak for an anchor, especially factoring in any uncertainty in our other values. However, if instead set the friction to 0.85, we get 5 times our other value at 108.2 kN, which is clearly good if we have estimated our other parameters correctly. This shows us that as the slope angle increases, the effect of friction is increased. This is because friction only appears in the perpendicular force term, not the parallel force term. \n\n**Porosity**:\nUsing constants of 0.5 for friction, 2600 kg/m^3 for wet bulk density, 8m^3 for volume, and 0 degrees for the slope, we can compare the range of porosities. At the low end for granite of 0.01, we get a strength of 100.1 kN. With a porosity of 30 corresponding to a very porous sandstone, we get 71.34 kN, corresponding directly to the expected 30% strength loss. Because porosity is in both the parallel and perpendicular force terms, it will not change effect size as the slope changes. The same is true for the rest of our terms.\n\n**Wet Bulk Density**:\nUsing constants of 0.5 for friction, 0.2 for porosity, 8 m^3 for volume, and 0 degrees for the slope, we can compare our high and low values for wet bulk density. Using 2750 kg/m^3, corresponding to the upper range of limestone, as our wet bulk density gives a strength of 86.24 kN. Using the low value for sandstone instead of 2200 kg/m^3 gives 69.0 kN, showing wet bulk density is a relatively minor factor in relation to the other factors considered so far.\n\n**Volume**: \nUsing constants of 0.5 for friction, 0.2 for porosity, 2600 kg/m^3 for wet bulk density, and 0 degrees for the slope, if we assume each side of our block is 2 m, we get a volume of 8 m^3 and a strength of 81.5 kN. If each side of our block is 0.2 m longer our total volume is 10.6 m^3, and the strength is 108.5 kN. If instead we overestimated the length of each side and each side is 0.2 m shorter our total volume is 5.8 m^3 and the strength is 59.4 kN. That means a 10% uncertainty in side length leads to a factor of almost 2 in the final uncertainty. Estimating the side length is thus an extremely important part of the equation, leading to a lot of potential error is estimated incorrectly.\n\n**Slope**:\nUsing constants of 0.5 for friction, 0.2 for porosity, 2600 kg/m^3 for wet bulk density, and 8 m^3 for the volume, with a slope of 0 we get 81.5 kN. Increasing the slope to -5 degrees (5 degrees uphill) increases the force to 95.4 kN, and decreasing the slope to 5 degrees decreases the force to 67.01 kN. Choosing a more extreme slope of -15 degrees increases the force to 121.0 kN, and decreasing it to 15 degrees decreases the force to 36.55 kN. With these constants, at a slope of 26.6 degrees, the boulder would start sliding downhill on its own. This shows that slope is an extremely important factor, as slopes that might not feel extreme can have a very significant effect. For reference, a 26 degree slope would be a blue ski run at most resorts. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf we return to the Red Rocks incident above, we can estimate the strength of the boulder to be 25.6 kN. This is very low for an anchor, especially given the uncertainty in our calculator, but we also know the line didn't hit 25 kN in a whip. This shows that some factor was present in the real world that's missing in our model. Tipping forces are likely a big part of it, but there's also a number of factors that could have been different from the model. This shows the importance of building large safety factors into your calculations.\n\nThis calculation method isn't fool proof, and shouldn't be entirely relied upon. There are important variables and context missing, and the variables we do cover need to be estimated in the field. The point of this is not to say whether one specific boulder is good or not by calculating the force required to move it. The point is to inform your decision making, in particular to help you understand the factors that influence the strength of a boulder and the effect size of your uncertainty. Always be conservative with your anchor choices and add extra backups if you have any doubt.

The first 40 tests were measured with a LineScale 2 on Peak Fast mode, with soft shackles connecting directly to the dynamometer. Tension was pulled by a single person per test on a 15:1 pulley system with 3\" SMC pulleys. Samples were between 2 and 3 meters long, and had a figure 8 knot terminating any end not being tested (on both sides for the bend tests, on one side for the device tests). The final 16 tests were done on Balance Community's break test machine, reading at 500 Hz, which Jerry Miszewski generously let us use for testing.\n\nThe cord in this test was about 2 years old and heavily used. Offcuts with notable abrasion spots were avoided where possible, although there was likely significant variation in wear across different test samples. The cord was broken because it was deemed due for retirement, and so represents conservative strength values for used cord. \n\nFor full discussion of Farmer Boy, see [the main

different brand of cord, or that his cord was less used than mine. My best guess is that my cord was simply more used than his. In the capstan tests, my cord tested as high as 4.04 kN, indicating higher \"true\" breaking strength in the middle, less used sections of cord. In the devices tested, our results are roughly similar, with minimum values with about .1 kN, or about 5%, across tests. It appears the breaking strength in devices was not highly affected by the wear on the cord. \n\nHis tests are spread out across two videos, both below. The first breaks 5mm and 6mm diamond braid in a Petzl Micro Trax and Pro Trax, and the second breaks the same cords in the CT Roll N Lock as well as a figure 8.\n\n### Micro Trax and Pro Trax\n\u003ciframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zlobh788yfE?list=PLHpbtlISIQAEHYX5XepT5iTWc2tuPfozb\" title=\"You Might Die If You Use This Tagline\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n### Roll N Lock and Figure 8\n\u003ciframe width=\"1366\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VDi5tG5e2QI?list=PLHpbtlISIQAEHYX5XepT5iTWc2tuPfozb\" title=\"Best Device For Hauling HUGE SLACKLINES?? - CT Roll N Lock\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n### Edits\nI will be trying to keep this page up to date with feedback and new information, and will keep track of edits as I make them here.\n1.

It is often called Farmer Boy because it is sold by Farmer Boy Ag. It is relatively large diameter, but relatively low strength. The product page lists its tensile strength as both 650 lbs (2.9 kN) and 800 lbs (3.6 kN), although 650 lbs is more accurate given the test results on it. Additional testing showed values of over 900 lbs (4.0 kN), which may indicate the more used seciton tested first was weaker, or strength was suffering more in the figure 8 knots than we had thought. It is often used to tag long highlines, but has also failed on a few highlines. \n\nWhile at the Paradise highline spot near Durango, Colorado, we performed 40 break tests in Farmer Boy cord in various knots and devices. We focused on common connecting knots like the sheet bend and alpine butterfly bend, as well as toothed and camming progress capture devices. Supplemental testing was done using Balance Community's break test machine on an additional 16 samples.\n\nThe goal of this testing is to give proven values for strength in this cord in common tagging situations. Hopefully it can help in the planning stage of projects, when deciding where Farmer Boy is a good fit to use as tag, and to help calculate safety ratio when able to measure forces while tagging. \n\n### Why use Farmer Boy?\n\nFarmer Boy is popular for a number of reasons. First of all, it is quite cheap, with each 300 meter spool costing only $37 USD at the time of writing. It is mostly used as an alternative to 550 paracord. It is about 100 lbs (0.44 kN) stronger than paracord according to its stated tensile strength, and it is roughly 1mm larger in diameter. The extra diameter means it is easier to grab by hand, and performs better in toothed and camming devices not meant for small diameter cord. \n\nIts main disadvantages compared to paracord are its weight (roughly double, although no weight is published for Farmer Boy and I don't currently have access to a scale to determine its weight) and it's increased packed size.\n\n### Tagline Forces from Paradise Mile Project\n\nThe impetus to test Farmer Boy came from our use of it while tagging the US Mile Project at Paradise. Both the walking gap and sight line were tagged first with FPV drones connected to 300 lb (1.3 kN) braided dyneema fishing line. For the sight line gap, the fishing line was used to pull over Farmer Boy directly, and the Farmer Boy was used to pull across the sight line, which was a mix of various cords with windsocks every 30-60m for most of the gap. For the walking gap, the braided fishing line first pulled 450m of 550 paracord to reduce the total weight, then 1 mile of Farmer Boy, which was then used to pull a [6mm pull rope](https://sgtknots.com/products/double-braided-polyester-pulling-rope) (12 kN, 28 g/m). The pull rope will be used to pull the webbing across. \n\nWhile the Farmer Boy was pulling in the pull rope, it was first redirected through a high kootenay pulley, down to a cluster of trees, and then through two more trees where it was hauled in by hand. There was a LineScale 2 dynamometer at the first cluster of trees attached to a rollerbiner, then the line went through a Petzl Mini Trax at the next tree, was slightly redirected through a Rollex at the next tree, and finally went through a Petzl Micro Trax at the final tree. Pulling was done caterpillar style between the Rollex and Micro Trax, and behind the Micro Trax. The second progress capture device was used to decrease the amount of force differential carried by the teeth of the first progress capture. The first progress capture was also placed after the first two redirects so the friction in those redirects would decrease the total force seen by the progress capture. \n\nWhile pulling the pull rope in with the Farmer Boy, the ideal tension read by the dyno was about 0.9 kN, with spikes up to 1.2 kN in wind or when the pull rope wasn't being released fast enough compared to the pulling speed. The dyno was at a redirect that we estimated to be 30 degrees, which we took to mean the force being read by the dyno was somehwat less than twice the force being seen by the Farmer Boy. We estimated it on site as being 1.5 times the force on the Farmer Boy, but if our angle estimation was correct, it should be closer to 1.9 times the force on the Farmer Boy, giving us a peak of roughly 0.6 kN. Because we were worried about the force in the Mini Trax, and in the handled ascenders used to pass knots, we were not worried about the force change due to the first kootenay redirect. The break test values below show that in both the Mini Trax and the two chained handled ascenders, we had plenty of safety ratio in our forces (roughly 3x safety factor). This shows Farmer Boy can be a suitable intermediary tagline for lines up to 1 mile long, at a price of roughly $200 USD. \n\n## Interpretation\n\nThe used cord broke consistently around 2.2 kN, which is approximately 75% of its rated strength. Although all of the bends broke at the knot, they broke at roughly 2.0 kN at the lowest, which is roughly 70% of rated strength and 90% of used strength. All of the bends tested seem suitable for use in tagging, although the alpine bend had some minor (but maybe not significant) strength advantage. \n\nOf the toothed and camming devices, the Petzl Mini Trax and CT Roll N Lock did significantly better (1.9kN, roughly 85% of used strength) than the Micro Trax (1.5kN, roughly 70% of used strength) when single wrapped. When doubled, the Mini Trax and Micro Trax both improved significantly. The Mini Trax improved up to 2.0 kN, and the Micro Trax up to 2.15, almost 100% of the used strength. The Roll N Lock actually got slightly worse when double wrapped, breaking at 1.8 kN or roughly 80% of used strength. This seems to be due to a sharp V shape in the cam of the Roll N Lock that can't accommodate two layers of cord as well. Due to the addition of twists and the increased difficulty of passing knots in double wrapped cords, it appears using a Petzl Mini Trax or CT Roll N Lock single wrapped is the best solution tested for progress capture in this cord. \n\nIf a handled ascender needs to be used on Farmer Boy, or it needs to be grabbed inline in some way, chaining two handled ascenders together with a carabiner (through the top of one into the handle of the other) works quite well at about 1.66 kN or 75% of used line strength. Both the Petzl Tibloc and the single handled ascender did the worst in the test, at about 1 kN or 45% of used strength. Chaining two handled ascenders is thus a major benefit if needing pass a knot, although it is not as strong as the best progress captures.\n\n### Update\n\nIn additional testing the capstan to capstan breaking value was just over 4 kN, indicating either that the cord was weaker at the ends where testing began and it had undergone more use, or that the figures 8s were influencing the breaking values more than had been thought. It is also possible the difference in break test method made up the difference, either through different calibration of the dynamometers or differences in pulling speed. \n\nThe Edelrid Spoc (2.33 kN) and Kong Duck (2.44 kN) each performed at near full strength compared to the original 8 to 8 tests. If these results reflect the performance of the devices rather than differences in testing sessions, the Spoc would outperform both the Mini and Micro Traxes, and the Duck would outperform the Roll N Lock. The Ropeman 1 from Wild Country did significantly worse than the other non-toothed camming devices, perhaps indicating the strength tests from this batch were not artifically inflated.\n\nTwo other unique progress captures were tested. The first is the CamJam XT from Nite Ize, an aluminum carabiner and progress capture available at very low cost ($16) from many hardware stores. The large version was tested here, which is rated for 1500 lbs (6.67 kN). It says \"MAX LOAD 500 LBS\" on the side of the device but this is it's WLL. It broke the cord at 2.74 kN, and in one test the cord broke at the figure 8 before breaking in the cam. This is quite impressive, and suggests Farmer Boy cord and the CamJam XT are a tempting budget option for tagging highlines. It does come with a few drawbacks though. It has no bearings or rolling surface of any kind, meaning pulling with it will be less efficient. Also, the way the device is loaded means the tag can't be pulled without making a 180 degree turn through the device. Finally, the device isn't rated for life-bearing use, meaning it should not be used in rescues. Many of the other progress captures are suitable for a light and handy rescue setup, as shown [in this video from the ISA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pbMM6Cuz5M)\n\nThe other unique progress capture tested was a 4 wrap prusik hitch made of Farmer Boy. The hitch was made of Farmer Boy because friction hitches often work best with matching diameter cord. While this would be a cheap and easy progress capture method, it slipped at 1.26 kN, and continued to slip at under 1 kN until the test was stopped. \n\n### Why not 3 sigma MBS? \n\nThe results given below represent the lowest break test from a sample of 3 for each type of test (except for the releasable sheet bend which was tested only once). The lowest tested strength is given rather than the 3 sigma calculated Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS), because of the low sample number, and the fact that tests were completed with a pulley system and on used cord. All of these would contribute to a high variance, giving a deceptively low MBS. It is also questionable whether 3 sigma MBS is appropriate for non life support soft goods. \n\nI believe testing well used cord with a pulley system simulates the real use conditions of this cord well, and should provide a conservative strength figure for the cord in use. \n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe Kong Duck appears to perform the best of all of the progress captures in 5mm Farmer Boy cord, breaking at 2.44 kN. The Edelrid Spoc is the best of the toothed devices, perhaps due to the smaller channel in the pulley and smaller gap between the pulley and teeth. Both are moderately cheaper than their closest competitors (the Roll N Lock for the Duck, and the Micro Trax for the Spoc). It is possible the high strength values of these devices was skewed by the differences across testing sessions.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that performance of any progress capture will vary significantly between different diameters and constructions of cord, so these results do not generalize to different taglines. Testing of different taglines in these devices is coming soon.\n\n## Results\n\nFor full break test results, see [Farmer Boy Full Break Tests](notes/FarmerBoyFullBreakTest.md).\n\n| Break Type | Sample Number | Breaking Strength (kN) | Comments |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 8 to 8 | 3 | 2.20 | Broke in middle |\n| Alpine Butterfly Bend | 1 | 2.10 | Broke at knot |\n| Double Sheet Bend (Yosemite Finish) | 2 | 1.98 | Broke at knot |\n| Releasable Double Sheet Bend | 1 | 2.15 | Broke at knot |\n| Zeppelin Bend | 2 | 2.02 | Broke at knot |\n| Micro Trax | 3 | 1.51 |  |\n| Doubled Micro Trax | 3 | 2.15 |  |\n| Mini Trax | 3 | 1.51 |  |\n| Doubled Mini Trax | 3 | 2.01 |  |\n| Roll N Lock | 2 | 1.91 |  |\n| Doubled Roll N Lock | 2 | 1.79 | Broke notably lower than single wrapped |\n| Handled Ascender | 1 | 1.06 |  |\n| Chained Handled Ascenders | 1 | 1.66 | 2 in line connected by carabiner |\n| Tibloc | 1 | 0.99 | Slips, tearing outside | \n| Capstan to Capstan | 2 | 4.04 |  |\n| Duck | 1 | 2.44 |  |\n| Ropeman 1 | 2 | 1.78 | Slipped around 1.6 |\n| Spoc | 2 | 2.33 |  |\n| Nite Ize CamJam XT | 2 | 2.74 | Slipped before breaking | \n| 4 Wrap Prusik | 3 | 1.26 | Made of Farmer Boy, Slips | \n\n### Edits\nI will be trying to keep this page up to date with feedback and new information, and will keep track of edits as I make them here.\n1.

These are discussed below. These tests are all characterized by low sample numbers and a lack of controls.\n\n### First Tests \nI first tested grog splices with Jerry in August of 2021, again in the Balance Community workshop. We tested three grogs, two I had premade and one I made on site. All were 5mm dyneema, but unfortunately we did not measure the bury lengths. One of the premade grogs was made of used dyneema from a Snatch whose splice had failed. That test failed the lowest. Oddly, the other two values are quite a bit higher than normal when compared to the larger testing done a year later on the same test machine. \n\n| Bury Size | Breaking Strength (kN) |\n| :-: | :-: |\n| ? | 28 | \n| ? | 37 |\n| ? | 34 |\n\n![Two broken grogs from first testing](/notes/images/JerryTest1.jpeg)\n![One broken grog from first testing](/notes/images/JerryTest2.jpeg)\n\n### Parking Lot Tests\nBefore first using the grogs I had made at the Fruit Bowl for Halloween 2021, we decided to try break testing them in the parking lot to make sure the 4\" bury size I had chosen was sufficient. We pulled the grogs between a van and a large pickup truck, using a Linescale 2 to read the values. We were able to pull up to 21.5 kN, which convinced us they were safe enough to rig at the festival. We could not break a 4\" bury grog, but we experimented with unburying one or both tails to see if we could force a failure. Using both tails unburied causes the brummel to invert and fail at extremely low forces. We didn't get a good reading, but it was nearly immediate. With only one of the two tails buried, the dyneema in the unburied tail fully unravels causing the brummel to come undone and the loop to fail around 15 kN. One tail appears to be slightly stronger than the other.\n\nHere is an inverted brummel from not burying either tail:\n\n![Inverted brummel](notes/images/undone_brummel.jpeg)\n\nHere is a fully unwoven tail from burying only one tail:\n![Unwoven brummel tail](notes/images/unwoven_dyneema.jpeg)\n\n\n### Jake's Scale Testing\nJake Monaghan heard about using grogs and wanted to test, but only had access to a pulley system. So he used 7/64\" dyneema in hopes of being able to scale up the test results to 5mm dyneema. His findings are below. \n\n![Jakes Test Results](/notes/images/JakesGrogTest.jpeg)\n\n\n### Edits\nI will be trying to keep this page up to date with feedback and new information, and will keep track of edits as I make them here.\n1.

They offer numerous advantages over existing highlines split connections, and are the first connector to facilitate semi-permanent connections. This method has been in testing for a year, and this article aims to be exhaustive with everything currently known about grogs and split highlines. \n\nSemi-permanent connections are weird based on the current paradigm of soft shackle and quicklink connections. They might challenge some existing notions about highline splits, but their benefits are worth a shift in mindset. So what is a grog, how do you make one, how strong are they, and where should I use them? Keep reading to learn all there is to know about grog splices.\n\n![Grog split used in a rig](notes/images/grogsplit1.jpeg)\n\n## What is a Grog?\nA grog is a method of splicing a continuous loop of braided material that makes use of a brummel splice, but buries each tail back into the working strand on the side it came from. Here is the [animated knots page for the grog sling](https://www.animatedknots.com/grog-sling-knot), which has good pictures and some discussion of grogs (some of the discussion does not match the testing found below, or the first hand experience I have of using grogs while slacklining).\n\nOur particular interest in grogs is as a connection method in highline splits, replacing soft shackles and quicklinks. If you're just interested in how they can be an improvement over other connection options, skip to *Benefits of the Grog* below. But if you'd like a deeper dive into how and why the idea for using them came about, keep reading here. \n\n### Origins\nTo my knowledge, grogs were first used in slacklining as the manufacturer recommended way of re-splicing the Souz Snatch, which was originally shipped with a weak splice that had a tendency of fully unraveling during normal use. \n\nBut the idea of using them in split connections first appeared in discussions between me and Owen Roll. I had been making a lot of variations of continuous loops in dyneema, and showed Owen some of the variations I had tried splicing. I had deemed them useless for splits because they don't open like a soft shackle, but Owen convinced me of the benefits. Fairly quickly we seemed to settle on the grog as being the best continuous loop method for the job. Sirio Zao made a [post on SlackChat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slackchat/posts/5048334728573697/) asking about use of a grog in splits in combination with a soft shackle before Owen and I shared our idea publicly, and no one seemed to have used them previously or been convinced to try them.\n\nThe first use of them in a split was by Jerry Miszewski on a 200m permarig in the fall of 2021, after I brought the idea to him and we break tested some I had made. I rigged lines with them at the Halloween Fruitbowl Gathering and GGBY, also in the fall of 2021, along with some other rigs. Jerry's line had 5mm grogs with 6\" buries and lock stitching on one side. My lines used 5mm grogs with 3-4\" buries and no lock stitching, and even rigged for days at a time at a festival saw no problems with the buries coming undone. The grogs were exceptionally easy to walk over, easy to splice and unsplice, and apparently safe enough. But I waited until now to share the grog in order to make sure I tested them fully before advocating them to the general public. \n\n### Semi-Permanent Split Connections\nOne of the main benefits of split connections is the ability to connect and disconnect separate pieces of webbing, instead of needing two long pieces of webbing capable of spanning the whole gap. Doesn't splicing a continuous loop through your webbing negate the adjustability of your split rig? It would, if these splices were permanent, but they aren't. \n\nGrog splices are semi-permanent, but not permanent. They can be left in place for a long time, but easily removed and reused at will. It takes me roughly five minutes to connect two highline segments with grogs, and about a minute to take them apart after they've been tensioned. I've done this at home and right at the anchor, which shows that field splicing with grogs is doable for someone who is used to making them. \n\nAlso, if you own a long rig, it is easy to pre-splice your segments in a smart way to give you optimal flexibility across different webbing lengths. For example, if you own six 50m highline segments, you can connect three 50m segments in one bag, two 50m segments in another bag, and leave the final 50m segment in its own bag. For any line up to 150m, you have a bag already packed with no need to make any connections. From 150-250m, you have to combine 2 bags with one split either at home or on site. For lines from 250-300m, you have to make 2 connections at home or on site. In all of these cases you have full flexibility, with minimal need to make connections for a specific rig. You also maintain the safety benefits of a split rig in every case, without having the hassle of making up to 5 connections while packing for a rig.\n\n### Continuous Loops in Dyneema\nWhy use a grog instead of another method of making a continuous loop? You can read all about some different ways of making continuous loops [at the sailing website L-36](https://l-36.com/loop.php), but even this isn't an exhaustive source. Like soft shackles, there are many ways of accomplishing the same thing with different strengths and trade offs. The primary reason for choosing a grog for split connections is having a secure splice (thanks to the brummel) without having to lock stitch. Lock stitching is relatively more difficult and time consuming than splicing, and slackliners might either be put off by the annoyance or be tempted to skip the lock stitch (risking full failure of the splice). Plus, lock stitching would require the loops to be more permanent than semi-permanent. I have not been able to find any information of the grog alternative mentioned at Animated Knots called the \"Brion Toss re-braided Brummel technique,\" so I can't compare that here.\n\n## Benefits of the Grog\n\n![Sleekness of grog](/notes/images/grogsplit2.jpeg) \n\n1. **Size:** Grogs are small. Two 5mm grogs at a split is roughly the size of one 5mm soft shackle, *without the button knot.* This means they add minimal bulk, and are extremely easy for leash rings to pass. \n2. **Weight:** One 5mm grog splice with 4\" buries weighs about 7.6g. A small 5mm soft shackle weights about 15.9g. An 8mm camp stainless steel quickink weights 76g. This means in addition to being about the size of one soft shackle without the button knot, two grogs also weigh less than one soft shackle. Two grogs also weigh one fifth of a single 8mm quicklink. While walking, this translates to less wobble and shake from the splits and a more continuous feel across the line. It is also less weight in the bag. \n3. **Security:** Because they are spliced shut, as long as the tails remain buried, grogs cannot open. Unlike soft shackles, they do not need to be taped shut. Unlike quicklinks, they do not need to be torqued with a wrench. Once spliced, they only need a simple visual inspection that the tails are buried before being sent out.\n4. **No tape:** Grogs do not need a noose or screw taped shut. They do not have button knots that need to be taped in place to keep from grabbing the leash ring. You may still want to tape your sewn loops or other parts of your split, but the connections themselves need no tape. This means less waste from connecting and disconnecting segments, and a connection that remains visually inspectable throughout the rig.\n5. **Easy to walk over:** Grogs are extremely easy to walk over. Their small size is part of this, but they also make a closed loop that is very stable. That means they won't twist, and feel fine to step directly on. No more problems at the split ruining your flow. \n\n## How to make a Grog\nBelow are written instructions on how to make a grog splice. Pictures of each step can be found at the [animated knots page for the grog sling](https://www.animatedknots.com/grog-sling-knot).\n1. Cut length of dyneema\n\t- Proper lengths are given in the table below\n\t- Simply cut ends at a 45 degree angle, no taper necessary\n2. Measure back from ends\n\t- Measure back one bury length from each end\n\t- Add a little padding to account for the size of the brummel (one side might need more padding than the other, try making a few and you'll see what I mean here)\n\t- Make a hole in each end of the dyneema at the distance you've marked (bury length + extra for brummel)\n3. Make brummel\n\t- Make sure the holes you made in the last step split the dyneema evenly: there should be 6 strands of dyneema on each side of the hole\n\t- Pass strand A through the hole in strand B, until the hole in strand A has gone through the hole in strand B\n\t- Then pass strand B through the hole in strand A\n\t- Pull the tail of both strands to cinch the brummel\n4. Bury the tails\n\t- Make sure each tail has at least your bury length coming out of the brummel\n\t- Bury each tail back in the same direction as it comes out of the brummel, beginning the bury as close to the brummel as possible\n\n**Lengths of dyneema needed for different bury lengths in 5mm grogs:**\n\n| Bury Size Inches | Inches of Dyneema Needed | Bury Size mm | mm of Dyneema Needed |  \n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 4\" | 20 | 102 | 508 |\n| 5\" | 25 | 127 | 635 |\n| 6\" | 29 | 152 | 737 |\n\nThese lengths should leave approximately one inch between the buried tails. This makes it significantly easier to splice, especially in sewn loops, and also avoids making a much longer grog than necessary.\n\n**Bury length is key:** Make sure your bury length is **at least 4 inches** when measured from the ends of the brummel. This is the minimum size needed to get reliable strength. Buries that are far too short (less than 3 inches) will slip out well before the brummel breaks, opening the sling. \n\n**Are tapered tails necessary?:** No tapers necessary, grogs tend to break at the brummel, not at the end of the buries. When they do break at the end of the buries, it's not any weaker than other tests, so adding tapers wouldn't add to their strength. Just cut your dyneema ends at a 45 degree angle. \n\n## Breaktests\nDisclaimer: the breaktests were performed at the Balance Community workshop using their breaktest machine, and with the assistance of Balance Community founder Jerry Miszewski. \nSee the full breaktests at [the complete breaktest page](notes/GrogSpliceFullBreakTest) (some additional testing data is also included there). All tests were performed on Amsteel Blue.\n\n![26 Broken Grog Splices](notes/images/GrogBreaks.jpg)\n\n### Determining MBS\nTo determine an MBS for the grogs, I've decided to run the MBS calculations on all of the tests with bury lengths 4\" or greater. This includes 15 break tests. I've excluded the used grogs, as well as one test where a 5\" bury grog got caught in the screw of the shackle pin and tore apart at 27.2 kN. \n\nThis gives us a three sigma MBS of 24.5 kN. For those who don't know, the three sigma MBS is calculated by subtracting three standard deviations of the data from the mean, and in theory represents the value that ~99.7% of all samples will break at or above. This is the strict standard that climbing and slackline gear is typically held to.\n\nIt is important to note the mean across the 15 samples is quite higher than the three sigma MBS at 31.0 kN. The reason the MBS is so low is because of the high variance in the data. The weakest grog in the sample set was 27.3 kN, the strongest was 35.9 kN (both had 4\" buries). This relatively large difference between weakest and strongest means a large standard deviation, and thus a more conservative three sigma MBS in relation to the mean. \n\n| Bury Size (in) | Three Sigma MBS (kN) | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN) |     |\n| :------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------------: | :-----------------------: | --- |\n|     4 - 6      |         24.5         |            31.0             |           27.3            |     |\n\n### Are Longer Buries Better?\nI advocate that **4 inches if the minimum bury length for a 5mm grog splice.** But is going longer better? As mentioned above, 4\" grogs had the weakest test of all the 4\", 5\", and 6\" buries we tested at 27.3 kN. But they also had the strongest at 35.9 kN. We tested 6 4\" grogs, 2 5\" grogs (if you exclude the one that got caught in the shackle pin), and 3 6\" grogs. Due to the very high value of 35.9 kN, I believe the higher variance in 4\" grogs is simply an artifact of testing twice as many. More testing would be needed to confirm or deny that, though. \n\nBelow are the values for just 6\" grogs, for people who would rather use a longer bury. Note that the mean breaking strength is the same, but the three sigma MBS and lowest tested value are much higher.\n\n| Bury Size (in) | Three Sigma MBS (kN) | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6 | 29.9 | 31.0 | 30.6 | \n\n### Smaller Bury Grogs\nTo show that **4\" in the minimum bury length,** here is the testing we did with smaller bury length grogs. The one 2\" bury grog we tested came undone at 21.4 kN. The tails slipped out of their buries and the brummel rolled open, so the loop came undone before the dyneema broke. This is the only test where this happened, and we didn't see a need to test more 2\" buries.\n\nThe 3\" buries all broke in the dyneema, but at notably lower values. Using 4\" buries gives higher strength, and helps ensure that slight errors in splicing don't lead to the loop coming undone. \n\n| Bury Size (in) | Three Sigma MBS (kN) | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 3 | 22.0 | 26.7 | 25.5 | \n\n### Grog Inside or Outside?\nGrogs can be installed one of two ways: with the brummel splice facing either inside, towards the center of the loop, or outside, away from the center of the loop. Grogs are made in the \"outside\" configuration, and can simply be rolled half a rotation to be used in the \"inside\" configuration. We tested 3 4\" grogs in both configurations, both for completeness, and because it was suggested (by Jake Monaghan) that the buries may be less likely to work their way out when configured inside. Practical testing hasn't showed any problem with buries working their way out, even on a permarig left for 8 months (one bury was lock stitched but the other was not - neither showed any signs of movement), so security of the buried tails doesn't seem to be an issue.\n\n| Bury Size (in) | Grog Inside or Outside | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 4 | Outside | 31.6 | 27.3 | \n| 4 | Inside | 30.6 | 29.0 | \n\nHaving the grog outside had a higher mean but also a much higher variance (both the high and low were in this set), so a three sigma calculation would be much lower for this set. Having the grog inside had a lower mean but much lower variance. My interpretation of this is that there is no significant difference between the two ways of orienting the grog.\n\n### Used Grogs\nWe also tested a few used grogs. We tested one each of a 3\" and 4\" bury that I used at a few festivals and a few other rigs. These were noticeably worn, and had been spliced and unspliced a number of times. We also tested two 6\" bury grogs that had been left on Jerry's 200m permarig for 8 months in Colorado at about 7000' elevation. \n\nThe one 3\" bury tested fairly low at 20.8 kN. The 4\" bury used in the same split broke at 27.8 kN, which is within the normal range for new 4\" buries. The two 6\" buries broke at 26.4 and 34.2 kN, which is again a high variance, but shows that grogs handle UV well and maintain their safety when left up for 8 months or less. The 6\" buries had been respliced only once to redo them for testing. \n\n| Bury Size (in) | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 3-6 | 27.3 | 20.8 | \n\n### Further testing\nSome more testing data is shown on the complete breaktest page. Due to the high variances of grogs, more testing would be beneficial to understand the range of values we could expect. It would also be beneficial to test how much grogs weaken sewn loops compared to soft shackles and quicklinks. For now, it is probably best to continue using soft thimbles with grogs as you would with soft shackles.\n\nFurther testing is also needed with both larger and smaller diameter dyneema. 6mm grogs could be a great way of adding strength without a significant bulk increase for people who desire more strength from each individual sling. But the bury lengths for these tests do not apply, and similar tests will have to be repeated to find the sufficient bury length for full strength 6mm grogs. Similarly, some people will want to try 4mm double wrapped grogs as they have 4mm double wrapped soft shackles. More testing is required to see how the splices react to being double wrapped, and how sewn loops respond when loaded with such small diameters. In general, choice of diameter in grogs is more flexible than in soft shackles, since there is no button knot to add or subtract bulk. However, bury lengths and strengths will need to be determined for whatever diameter is being used - so far only 5mm grogs can be advocated for.\n\n## How and Where to Use Grogs\nKnowing their benefits and their breaking strength, how and where should you use grogs in your split connections? While an individual 5mm grog is significantly weaker than either a 5mm soft shackle or 8mm quicklink, two 5mm grogs are roughly the same strength as both while also being smaller and lighter. Therefore, my guideline would be **replace any single soft shackle or quicklink with two grogs.** For example, on a Y2K or Dura-La-Vida style connection where offset loops are generally connected with 1 quicklink or soft shackle each, use two grogs in place of each single connector. By using grogs in these cases, you gain a significant increase in redundancy while maintaining strength, and decreasing size and weight.\n\n![Example of through-all-four connection with grogs](/notes/images/grogsplit3.jpeg)\n\nHowever, there are also places where we use two connectors for redundancy, even though the strength of one connector is plenty. An example of this is when we put two soft shackles through both main and backup loops, with the backup loops tucked inside the main loops (through-all-four style connection). Here, two grogs sharing load should be roughly 50 kN strong, which is stronger than almost any webbing. And because there are two separate grogs, they are still redundant. For this reason, you can **replace two soft shackles that connect the same pieces of webbing with two grogs.** This gives you a connection that is plenty strong enough, and half the size and weight. \n\nIn general, any split connection can be done with two grogs, as long as there is not a failure mode of the webbing where one grog will be loaded on its own. \n\n## Conclusion\nGrog splices offer significant advantages over other connectors used in split highlines. They are smaller, lighter, and are significantly better to walk on and past than other connectors. When used in pairs, they maintain all of these advantages while also matching strength and adding redundancy. They are easily adapted to the most common split styles (4 simple loops, Y2K, and DLV) and can offer some advantage over the current standard in every case. They are relatively quick to install (about 5 minutes to splice two grogs) either at home or in the field, and are even quicker to remove (about 1 minute to remove two loaded grogs). If you're not convinced, try walking a line with them.\n\nI've tried to make this an exhaustive list of everything we know about grogs, but if you have additional questions reach out and I will try to answer them. \n\n### Grog Links\nBelow is a list of the other articles I've made regarding grogs, that I will try to keep updated as I go.\n1.

Braid Polyester Cord in Knots and Devices\n\n![Collection of progress captures tested](notes/images/ProgressCaptures.jpeg)\n\n## Introduction \n\n[Double Braid 6mm Pull Rope from SGT Knots](https://sgtknots.com/products/double-braided-polyester-pulling-rope) is a high strength and relatively inexpensive tagline that has been used as the final tagline for a number of 500m+ projects in the US over the past few years. It is rated for 2700 lbs (12 kN) and costs roughly $220 for 375m of tag. One of its main advantages is it comes with spliced ends, commonly believed to be full strength, which negates the strength reduction due to knots that other taglines suffer from.\n\nThe tagline is the subject of current interest because it recently snapped in a progress capture during the Paradise Highline Community mile long US record attempt (more about the failure below). Although it is quite strong, its practical limit was found in its performance in progress capture devices. This testing has been performed in order to provide reliable data on the breaking strength of this cord in the widest variety of progress capture devices possible, along with common knots. Hopefully this will provide better information for planning and on site decision making for big rigs, as well as facilitate better failure analysis of the US mile project.\n\n### Information on Pull Rope\n\nDouble Braid Pull Rope is significantly cheaper than 6mm cord, and is rated about 60% stronger (compared to 7.3 kN Maxim cord). There is no published weight for Pull Rope, although it is likely heavier than 6mm accessory cord. It comes with spliced eyes on both ends, which are commonly believed to be full strength despite there being no claim to that effect from the manufacturer. Because it is full polyester, it is also quite low stretch. It has been seen as a great tagline for large projects due to it's low cost, high strength, and suitability for use in powered winches. \n\n![Micro Trax with desheathed Pull rope](notes/images/MicroTraxBrokenCord.jpeg)\n\n### Tagline Failure at US Mile Project\n\nDuring the Paradise Highlines US Mile (1670m) attempt, the Double Braid Pull Rope snapped while pulling the webbing across. At the time, there was roughly 1200m of Slacktivity Y2K in the gap. On the static side, the Pull Rope went through a kootenay pulley, then a Petzl Mini Traxion, before going into a gas powered winch. During the hold which preceded the failure, a Micro Traxion had been added between the Mini Trax and the winch but was not yet holding tension. The Mini Traxion was intended to be a backup in case the winch slipped, and in order to pass the soft shackle connections between sections of Pull Rope, a pulley system attached to two in-line handled ascenders was used to get the soft shackles from in front of the Mini Traxion to behind the winch.\n\nDuring holds, the winch engine was having difficulty turning over with so much tension on the line (estimated at up to 4kN depending on the wind). As a solution, the static side team decided to remove wraps from the winch (from 4 wraps to 2), releasing tension onto the Mini Traxion. This is very dangerous, as [this report of a winch incident](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slackchat/permalink/6791126417627844/) indicates, but was the solution that the team decided on during the rig. They had performed this operation succesfully on an earlier hold, but at the time of the incident, as soon as wraps were removed from the winch the tagline snapped at the Mini Traxion, shooting violently out from the cliff, breaking a carabiner attached to the kootenay, and causing 1200m of webbing to drop into the trees below.\n\n![Broken carabiner from mile project](notes/images/SnappedCarabiner.jpg)\n\nThe system used was not ideal, and the failure could have been prevented with some small changes, like moving the backup progress capture to behind the winch or using a different method of reducing tension on the winch to help it turn over. However, it seems the system that was used was chosen because of the high strength rating of the Pull Rope, and a lack of awareness about the limitations of progress capture devices. Hopefully, this testing will shed light on the forces involved during the actual incident, and help provide useful data on the strength of used Pull Rope in devices.\n\n## Testing Details\n\nThis testing was performed using Balance Community's break test machine taking readings at 500 Hz. Tests were performed by Philip Queen, Ana Lincoln, and Logan Henning. Tests were performed on roughly 2m long segments of Pull Rope, and were terminated on one end in a figure eight unless otherwise mentioned.\n\nThis testing would not have been possible without the generous donation of the remainder of the snapped section of pull rope by Vova Kozlov. \n\n## Interpretation\n\nCapstan and spliced eye values are both weaker than expected, with a capstan to capstan value of 6.79 kN, instead of the 12 kN rating, and a spliced eye value of 5.46 kN. Lower than expected capstan values likely indicate the cord was significantly worn, while low spliced eye values likely indicate the spliced eyes were never full strength. \n\n![Broken pull rope spliced eyes](notes/images/PullRopeSplicedEyes.jpeg)\n\nFor knots, the Figure 8s tested were stronger than the weaker spliced eye at 5.6 kN. Alpine Bends and Double Sheet Bends were both weaker than figure 8s, but similar to each other, at 4.6 and 4.7 kN respectively.\n\nFor toothed progress capture devices, the Petzl Pro Traxion performed the best at 3.9 kN. Unlike in the [Farmer Boy testing](notes/FarmerBoyKnotsDevices), the Micro Traxion (3.2 kN) outperformed the Mini Traxion (3.1 kN), which also slipped at 2.9kN in the same test. The Edelrid Spoc was also tested, and matched the Mini Trax at 3.1 kN. The Micro Trax was tested doubled, and performed significantly better at 4.33 kN, the best of any of the toothed progress captures. We also attempted to test the Mini Trax doubled, and the one sample broke at 4.11 kN, but wedged in between the sideplate and the pulley, and more testing seemed to risk hurting the device. \n\nA second set of tests was done on the Pro Trax with an extra meter or more of space between the termination knot and Trax in order to see if the short space between the knot and device in the tests was influencing the breaking strength. The results were not significantly different (3.9 kN for the short distance, 3.7 kN for the longer distance), indicating the short throw distance used in these tests was not problematic. \n\n![Mini Trax to Micro Trax setup](notes/images/MiniToMicroSetup.jpeg)\n\nWe also tested a chained Mini Trax and Micro Trax to try to replicate the Paradise Mile failure and see if chaining toothed progress captures does improve their performance. The tagline was loaded into the Mini Trax, and then the tail was loaded into a Micro Trax about a foot away and at a shallow angle from the direction of pull. This broke at 5.1 kN, showing a massive benefit to chaining progress captures. This test does not adequately reflect the setup of the mile failure though, because the Micro Trax had not yet seen tension since nothing had pulled behind it yet. \n\nThree configurations of handled ascenders were tested. A standard, single handled ascender broke at 3.3 kN. Two handled ascenders, chained in line with a carabiner, broke at 4.2 kN after slipping at 3.5 kN. The same two ascenders, connected with a sliding X in a short nylon sling instead of a carabiner, broke higher at 4.5 kN. \n\n![Ropeman 1 with broken cord stuck in sideplate](notes/images/Ropeman1.jpeg)\n\nOf the three standard camming devices tested, the Kong Duck performed the best at 3.6 kN. This outperformed the Petzl Micro Trax but not the Pro Trax, showing that the general rule that camming devices preserve more strength than toothed devices is false. The Roll N Lock also slightly outperformed the Micro Trax at 3.4 kN, while the Wild Country Ropeman 1 broke as low as 1.6 kN. We also tested an old Rock Exotica cam, which we were not able to find a device name for, but which broke very high at 4.2 kN, but began slipping at 2.1kN. We did one test each of the Petzl Rescuecender (an older than current model), which broke at 1.6 kN, and the very cheap Nite Ize CamJam XT, which broke at 3.9 kN. The CamJam continues to impress for a device costing only $15, although its design makes it very impractical for use on bigger lines where knots in the tagline will have to be passed.\n\n![Rock Exotica camming device of unknown name](notes/images/RockExoticaCam.jpeg)\n\nFinally, we tested three configurations of 4 wrap prusiks. The first was made out of a short sling of Pull Rope, which broke very high 5.2 kN, but started slipping as early as 1.7 kN. We also did one test each of two models of Sterling Hollow Blocks. The 6.8mm, rectangular style hollow block, slipped at .8 kN and never was able to hold more tension. The 5mm round style hollow block slipped at 2.7 kN, and also was unable to hold more tension.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIn the worn Pull Rope, the spliced eyes have a small advantage over just terminating the sections in a Figure 8. The Figure 8 based Flemish Bend (untested) would be the strongest direct connection, although much more difficult to untie than an Alpine Bend or Double Sheet Bend, which were indistinguishable in this testing. \n\nFor progress capture devices, the Petzl Pro Trax was the best performing, followed by the Kong Duck. If doubling the tagline in the device is suitable for your project, the double wrapped Mini Trax outperformed all of the single wrapped devices. Whichever device is chosen, if it is possible to reach forces near 3 kN, using multiple devices in line (with tension pulled through both) will significantly increase your safety margin. \n\nTwo handled ascenders connected with a sliding X outperformed all other progress captures, and if there is a way to mind them (by having slight tension pulled from the front of the ascenders) they are the best option for high tension use of Pull Rope. Prusiks made of Pull Rope have a similarly high break strength, but have a tendency to slip badly. They may be a good, cheap backup option to the main progress capture, and could also serve as a tension limiting device.\n\n## Results\n\nFor full break test results, see [Pull Rope Full Break Tests](notes/PullRopeFullBreakTest.md).

I got a lot of feedback that splicing in the field was either:\n- Too complicated\n- Too time consuming\n- Added too much potential for error\n\n\nA few days later, I decided to make a video showing how easy it was to do a connection on site. To my surprise, it only took 5 minutes for me to splice the whole connection, even while explaining what I was doing. \n\nIn addition to showing how quick splicing on site is, this video highlights how simple the process is, and in particular how few decisions there are to make while doing it. The key is to *premake your grog splices at home,* which allows you to take them apart at the anchor and have a perfect guide of how to resplice exactly as it was at home. Below I'll cover what you need to field splice grogs, how to resplice grogs you've premade, and what key points you need to make sure to do in the field. \n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/etHNU4AEiNE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## What You Need To Field Splice Grogs\n1. Two premade grogs per connection point\n\t- At home, you should make sure you've made your brummel correctly, have bury lengths \u003e4\" (measured from the brummel), have evenly split your dyneema when making the holes (6 strands on each side of the splice for 12 strand braids), and have practiced making grogs enough to feel *very* comfortable making them.\n\t- If you're new to making grogs, consider having someone double check your grogs while you're still at home - in person ideally, or over the phone or internet. \n2. A fid that works well with your amsteel\n\t- If using selma fids, I highly recommend sizing up compared to the diameter of your amsteel. For example, use a 5.5 for 5mm amsteel, or a 7.5 for 6mm amsteel.\n3. The webbing pieces to connect\n4. Someone to double check your work\n\nThat's it! No tape or measuring tools required. \n\n## How to Resplice a Grog in the Field\n1. Take apart your grog. \n\t- I normally leave the grogs attached to the webbing bag for the segment they will be connecting. For transportation and storage, I leave the tails unburied but the brummel made.\n2. Pass the loose dyneema of the first grog through all points you are connecting.\n\t- Make sure you get every loop you need to splice in. In some cases, that's either both main loops or both backup loops. In other cases, it will be all four, or may include DLV or Y2K style loops. \n\t- It may help to push the loops to one side (towards the center of the grog, opposite the splices) to give yourself more room to splice.\n3. Identify the strand that has the sharper bend left over from the brummel (strand A). This is the strand that will be **spliced through** first. \n\t- If you have trouble identifying which strand is spliced through first, consider marking it while taking apart the brummel.\n4. Pass the other strand (strand B) through strand A at the hole left over from the old brummel. Make sure you pull strand B through far enough that the hole in strand B has passed through the hole in strand A.\n5. Pass strand A through the hole in strand B and pull on the loop created to make sure you've made a proper brummel. \n6. Bury the tail of strand A back in direction it started from.\n\t- The brummel will have a hole on the strand A side, that enters into the braid of the main loop. On this side of the grog, you can splice the tail directly back into the hole. \n7. Bury the tail of Strand B back in direction it started from.\n\t- The brummel on this side won't have a clear hole like the other side. Choose the closest *pick* (a V-shape made by the braid of the amsteel) to the brummel that's fully accessible. You should be able to bury this tail without interfering with the brummel. Generally I can see one pick that would be quite difficult to splice, and I choose the next pick down from that one to bury into.\n8. Repeat steps 2-7 with your second grog.\n9. Inspect both grogs well to ensure everything was done right. \n\n## Key Points for Field Spliced Grogs\nThis list will cover the most important things to make sure of when field splicing grogs. It leaves out some of the key points for *making grogs* because it assumes the grogs were premade properly beforehand, and are just being respliced. Some of the main things its missing are checking proper bury length, and making sure the original holes are made to split the braid evenly (i.e. 6 strands on each side of the hole for 12 strand amsteel).\n\n1. Make sure the brummel is properly done. Each strand should go through the other once, and be spliced through once. Pulling on either both tails, or opposite sides of the loop shouldn't move the splice at all. \n2. Make sure the tails are buried in the right place. One should go into the hole made by the brummel, and the other should be as close as possible to the brummel (about one pick away from the brummel.) Verify that the exposed tails (between the brummel and start of the buries) don't look bigger than they need to be.\n3. Make sure the ends of the tails aren't sticking out of the end of the bury. The tails should be fully buried, but it can be easy to take the fid out too early while burying them. The side of the grog opposite the brummel should be smooth with no loose strands sticking out. The only feature of that side is a small thin spot between the buries. \n4. Make sure you have connected exactly what you think you connected. In addition to connecting the right sides of the webbing, making both mains on top and right side up, etc., verify that everything that needs to be connected *for safety* is. Pull on both mains, both main and backup pairs, and both backups separately to make sure every failure mode is protected. \n\nThis should cover the main potential mistakes in field splicing the grogs, assuming the grogs were made properly beforehand. Premaking the grogs is key to eliminating decision making on site, which in turn helps reduce the possibility for errors. There may be other mistakes that I've missed though. If you think of any, please let me know.\n","lastmodified":"2025-03-30T19:11:21.133593722Z","tags":null},"/notes/Tensioning-Highline-Curtain-Rods":{"title":"","content":"#shower-curtain #buen-chancho #rigging #breaktests #double-blakes-hitch #friction-hitch\n# Tensioning Highline Curtain Rods: Beyond the Clutch\n\n![[notes/images/10_4_double_Blakes1.webp]]\n\nThe *shower curtain*, or *buen chancho* system of highline rigging has become a staple of rigging big lines. [Invented by Slackline Canarias](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1LSoHrT2sn/) and shared widely in 2019, the practice has allowed smaller crews to rig bigger lines by reducing the amount of pulling power needed, and significantly reduced the strain on tag lines. The shower curtain system typically involves having an extra tensioned tagline, called the \"curtain rod,\" that the highline is periodically attached to with pulleys. The curtain rod separates the force from the weight of the highline from the force of pulling by holding the highline's weight, making it much easier to pull across. Because the curtain line needs to be low stretch and low friction, Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE, also known by the brand name Dyneema) is the material of choice, with 4mm being the most common diameter. While UHMWPE functions very well as a curtain rod, the main difficulty with it is finding a way to tension it.\n\nThe tighter a curtain rod is, the easier it is to pull the highline across it. This is because there is less uphill pulling and less weight that needs to be supported by the tagline. But tensioning a thin UHMWPE cord is very difficult. Traditional rope gripping methods like toothed or cammed ascenders, hitch cords, and progress capture pulleys either don't grip properly or easily damage the UHMWPE. This led to the development of a number of techniques that workaround the limitation of the slippery curtain, including simply attaching a static rope to one end of the curtain rod to enable tensioning with normal methods of tensioning ropes. But by far the most commonly used has been the *clutch*. A clutch is a short piece of UHMWPE with a fixed eye on one end that the curtain gets spliced into. The curtain gets buried 12-18 inches into the clutch, and it looks and functions similarly to a whoopie sling. This allows you to grip the curtain anywhere along its length, pull tension, and then when the curtain is anchored in place the clutch can be moved. The difference between a clutch and a whoopie sling is that on a whoopie both strands are coupled to share tension easily, which results in a more stable grip. This difference in loading means that while clutches can hold tension very well, they are very sensitive to anything touching the loose front. Even slight pressure on the front can cause them to slip under tension. In addition to the risk of slipping, clutches also can't be added or removed while the curtain is rigged, so they require careful planning of where the curtain will need to be tensioned. They also tend to gum over time when used with a curtain rod that has a coating, which can be a major hassle during a rig.\n\nGiven the numerous issues with clutches, it is time to thank them for the lines rigged with them and move on. Whatever replaces clutches should be resistant to accidental slipping, easy to add or remove at any time and anywhere on the curtain, and should be as light and strong as a clutch. Luckily, the replacement that satisfies all of these conditions is here.\n\n## Friction Hitches\n\nWhile planning the [\"Absurdian\" 3K project](https://riggerousthinking.com/blogposts/3kByNumbers.html) Pierce Kenji mentioned he had been testing a few different friction hitches as a way of replacing clutches. Instead of tying the friction hitch with standard hitch cord, he was using 3mm Amsteel. While matching two very slippery materials together is unintuitive for a \"friction hitch\", it worked the best in his testing. Using 2.5 mm Amsteel on 4 mm curtain rod, he was able to break test a 6 wrap prusik up to 7 kN, breaking the curtain. He then tested various other knots up to 4 kN to see what held consistently, and tested 2.5 mm, 3 mm, and 4mm amsteel for the hitch cord. He tested French prusiks (autoblocks), swabisch, distel, and Blakes hitches, and found the best performer was a double Blakes hitch in 3mm cord. The double Blakes hitch involves tying a Blakes hitch with each tail of the 3mm cord, with both Blakes hitches pointing the same direction, and then loading the connecting strand between the hitches. The Blakes he was tying had 6 wraps for each Blakes, and the tail went back under the first two wraps, which I will abbreviate as a 6/2 Blakes. We were able to stress test this double Blakes method when we rigged a shakedown 1.1 km line in Bend, Oregon before the 3K project. It handled well enough that we decided to use the double Blakes instead of clutches on the 3K. \n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFvb1bWvyL_/?utm_source=ig_embed\u0026amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

We were able to solve this by connecting two different double Blakes together to equalize them. With this double double Blakes method we were able to pull up to 7 kN on the curtain. We pulled to 7 kN so that it would settle to 5 kN before sending webbing, which in hindsight put us unnecessarily close to the limits of the curtain. In theory, the two double Blakes together would slip around 8 kN, but we were far beyond the scope of the testing that had been done. We tensioned the curtain from both anchors, and one side had more troubles with slipping then the other. In general it worked well though, allowing us to add and remove the tensioning system whenever we wanted. The grip worked well enough that we also used the double Blakes as part of the curtain termination while sending the webbing. We were quite nervous when loading the double double Blakes to 7 kN however, and were eager to see how close to the limits of the system we were.\n## Testing\n\nRecently, I was able to break test a few different friction hitches on curtain rod with Jerry Miszewski on the Balance Community break test machine. This was exploratory testing, where we did not repeat tests that did not look promising. The full breaktests can be found in [breaktests]. We tested the 6/2 double Blakes we used on the 3K and it slipped at 4.1 kN. We tried tying the curtain in a knot behind the double Blakes to see if back tension helped prevent the slippage, and it held until 4.8 kN but then continued to slip. When we tried the double double Blakes hitch, which is two double Blakes hitches equalized together, it slipped at 6 kN instead of the 7 we were able to achieve at the 3K.\n\n![[3mm_amsteel_BT.webp]]\n\nCurious to see if other hitches worked as well, we tested a 5 wrap prussic, a Valdotain Tresse, and a combination of a Blakes hitch and Valdotain Tresse I came up with. The prussic slipped at 3.6, the Valdotain Tresse at 3.3, and the Blakes/Valdotain Tresse combo at 3.8. Since none of these improved on the double Blakes, we stopped testing alternative hitches and tried to improve on the holding power of the Blakes Hitch instead.\n\n![[3mm_amsteel_VT_loaded.webp]]\n\nFollowing the theory that more wraps translates to more friction, we tried an 8/3 double Blakes and it slipped at 5.2 kN. Since that showed improvement, we tried even more wraps with a 10/4 double Blakes and it broke the curtain at 7.7 kN. This was a significant improvement, and since we had been reusing the curtain between tests and it was visibly damaged, we repeated the test with a fresh piece of curtain. With new curtain, the 10/4 double Blakes broke at 9.2 kN which is over half the 16 kN MBS of the curtain. Thinking we could reduce the strain on the curtain at the start of the hitch to increase the breaking strength, we tried a double Blakes where the front Blakes hitch was an 8/3, and the rear was a 10/4. This broke the curtain at 8 kN, indicating there isn't an advantage to mixing different variants of the Blakes hitch in a double Blakes. Given the testing we did, we were content that a 10/4 double Blakes is close to optimal for 3mm Amsteel friction hitches on 4mm curtain rods. It would be good to do further testing to determine a statistically significant breaking strength for the 10/4 Blakes hitch.\n\n### Comparison to Clutches\n\nThere is surprisingly little data on clutches. There is one [video from Ryan Jenks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtH6iQQNa5s) that has a single break test of a 5mm clutch. With a 33\" bury it breaks at 17.1 kN, or 71% of 5mm Amsteel's 24 kN MBS. I have tested one 28\" bury 4mm clutch on a 4mm UHMWPE curtain and it broke at 12 kN, or 75% of the curtain's 16 kN MBS. The testing for both systems is rather limited, but clutches seem significantly stronger at ~70% of the curtain MBS compared to the double Blakes which only gets ~55% of the curtain MBS. At the upper limits of curtain rigging that does add quite a bit to the safety factor, but those high tensions are only on the double Blakes during tensioning. When the webbing is being sent on the curtain, which is when the forces on the curtain are highest, the curtain is anchored with another system.\n\nDouble Blakes more than make up for their lower strength in usability. They can easily be added or removed at any point in the curtain, even under significant tension. Clutches must be spliced in place, and depending on how far your curtain anchor is from the end of a splice may need to be fed up to 100m to be put in a usable position. It is much easier to tie a double Blakes exactly where its needed, do any necessary tensioning, and then remove it. If you forget a clutch, or it gets stuck in place during rigging (this has happened to me), there is very little you can do. But its possible to tie a double Blakes with the tail of the curtain and tension with it. There isn't any published testing about matched diameter double Blakes, but in a pinch it will allow you to at least put some tension on the curtain. To me the usability of the double Blakes far outweighs the loss in strength compared to the clutch.\n## How to Use the 10/4 Blakes\n\nTo make the hitch cord, cut 42\" of 3mm amsteel. Then tie an overhand knot 3\" from each end of the Amsteel, and bury the ends on the outsides of the overhand back on the inside edge of the overhand. This makes it less likely for the tails to slip out over time.\n\n![[3mm_amsteel_friction_hitch.webp]]\n\nTo tie the double Blakes, take one end and wrap it ten times around the curtain, wrapping towards the gap and away from the anchor. Then bring the end back and pass it under the first four wraps, again moving towards the gap and away from the anchor. See the [Animated Knots on how to tie a Blakes hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/blakes-hitch-knot)for visual reference of a 4/2 Blakes hitch. Pull the tails on each side of the knot to set it, and you have one Blakes hitch. Repeat the same steps on the other end to make the other Blakes hitch. Make sure both Blakes hitches wrap the same way, going from the anchor towards the gap. You want at least 3\" of tail coming out of each Blakes hitch, which should match the amount of reburied amsteel. Load the loop in between the 2 knots to tension.\n\n![[10_4_double_blakes.webp]]\n\nOne of the benefits of the double Blakes hitch is it can easily be moved along the curtain when it isn't loaded. It will however be harder to move after being tensioned, so the first step to moving it is to feed some tail back into the knot to loosen it. Then slide the hitches in either direction by pushing either the front or back of the hitch. You may need to move one hitch at a time. Before loading it again, make sure there's still at 3\" of tail coming out of each hitch, as the tails can easily get shorter while moving the knot. Finally pull the tails on each side of each Blakes hitch to set the knots again, and it is ready to load again.\n\nTo undo the knot, loosen it by pushing the tails into the knot. If it's really set, it may need some massaging to come undone. Once it's loose, untie each Blakes hitch and the cord will be totally freed from the curtain.\n\n## Breaktests\n\n![[melted_curtain_testing.webp]]\n\n| Knot                    | Variant           | Slip/Break | Force (kN) | Notes                                              |\n| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |\n| Prussic                 | 5 wraps           | Slip       |            |                                                    |\n| Double Blakes           | 6/2               | Slip       | 4.1        |                                                    |\n| Double Blakes           | 6/2               | Slip       | 4.82       | With stopper knot, on used curtain from prior test |\n| Valdotain Tresse        | 8 wraps 4 crosses | Slip       | 3.29       | On used curtain from prior test                    |\n| Blakes/Valdotain Tresse | 8 wraps 4 crosses | Slip       | 3.83       | On used curtain from prior test                    |\n| Double Blakes           | 8/3               | Slip       | 5.16       | On used curtain from prior test                    |\n| Double Blakes           | 10/4              | Break      | 7.71       | On used curtain from prior test                    |\n| Double Blakes           | 10/4              | Break      | 9.21       |                                                    |\n| Double Blakes           | 8/3, 10/4         | Break      | 8.00       | Front Blakes 8/3, rear Blakes 10/4                 |\n| Double Double Blakes    | 6/2               | Slip       | 6.01       | 2 double Blakes equalized with soft shackle        |\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFriction hitches offer significant improvements over clutches for tensioning curtains. They can be added and removed at any point, and do not become stuck like clutches. They are also less sensitive to slipping from forward pressure, since they tighten at the front of the hitch. While they are weaker than clutches, they still have plenty of safety factor for most use cases and their ease of use more than makes up for their lower strength.\n\nOf the friction hitches tested so far, the 10/4 double Blakes does the best. While other friction hitches slip, it breaks the curtain at 8.5 kN or around 55% of the curtain's MBS. If you are dealing with lower tensions, or want a solution that slips without breaking the curtain, an 8/3 double Blakes will slip at around 5.5 kN. A 42\" piece of 3mm Amsteel long enough to tie the 10/4 double Blakes weighs only 9 grams, and costs roughly $2 USD. Making a couple hitch cords and adding them to your highline kit will give you a flexible solution to deal with curtain rigging problems.\n","lastmodified":"2025-03-30T19:11:21.133593722Z","tags":null}}
