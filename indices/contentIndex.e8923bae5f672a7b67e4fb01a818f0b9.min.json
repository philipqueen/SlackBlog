On a shorter highline, that max expected force should be about 7 kN. I have measured this with a heavier person taking a leashfall on a 50m nylon line, and while slightly longer lines rigged correctly can mitigate this force, I still believe 7 kN is a good calculation starting point for highline forces. That would give a minimum connector strength of 21 kN with a 3:1 safety factor, and of 28 kN with a 4:1 safety factor. These values are right in line with the webbing strengths of most nylon and high stretch polyester webbings commonly used on shorter highlines. Keep in mind that we're interested in the strength of the connector in the configuration it will be used in so an aluminum carabiner, for example, rated to 21 kN, is not suitable because it will not be 21 kN once triloaded between two sewn loops. \n\nWhat happens as lines get longer? The highest forces recorded on very large highlines are around 20 kN in wind (the Asbestos 1.9 km reached 20.5 kN peak force, and the Norway 2.8km reached 19.5 kN peak force), and it is clear a 21 kN connector will no longer suffice. But achieving even a 3:1 safety factor then requires a 60kN connector, which is unnecessary when most high tech webbings used in these big lines break between 30 and 35 kN in a sewn loop. This motivates the more general recommendation that your connector in a split system should be as strong as the strength of the webbing it is attached to in a sewn loop. \n\n![\"The Cursive W\" split system - side view](notes/images/cursiveWside.jpg)\n![\"The Cursive W\" split system - top view](notes/images/cursiveWtop.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe \"Cursive W\" split system with two soft shackles. Structurally, this is very similar to \"the W\" shown below, but the long soft shackle crosses back and forth to connect to all of the loops. The 5mm soft shackles shown here are each ~45+ kN, and are suitably strong for split connections. The double wrapped soft shackle connecting the main loops should be twice that strength. \u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\nA connector with a strength in the low-to-mid 30s should be sufficient for almost all highline webbings on the market now. 5mm button knot soft shackles, 5mm grog slings doubled, 4mm button knot soft shackles doubled, and most 8mm quicklinks will have a strength ~35+kN. Some heavier nylon and polyester webbings or older high tech webbings have strengths of above 40kN, and it is likely that the next generation of high tech webbings will be stronger, so there may be an incentive for stronger connectors for some users.\n\nIn some split setups, two connectors can be used in such a way that they share load. In theory, you can add the two connectors' strengths together if the load is perfectly shared, but in order to preserve redundancy, each connector should be strong enough on its own. \n\n\n### Redundancies\n\nSplit highlines offer major safety advantages over traditional single strand highlines, but require paying much closer attention to redundancy. Between the anchors, a traditional highline requires one redundancy: A backup in case the mainline fails. Split highlines, however, have many required redundancies that can depend on the system used: What if one mainline fails? What if the other mainline fails? What if both fail? What if a connector fails? \n\nWhen presented with a new split system, it can be hard to go through every possible failure mode. A typical test is to pull (with your hands) on both mainlines, then both backups, then each separate combination of main and backup, and make sure each can correctly oppose force and loads the connectors well. \n\nThe pull test ensures redundancy of your webbing, but it's also important to test the redundancy in your connection. When doing the pull test, pay attention to which connectors are loaded in which situation, and how they are loaded. It's a good idea to remove one of your connectors and see what happens when you repeat the pull test. Once you're satisfied that connector is redundant, put the split back together and remove the other connector. \n\nThis may seem like a lot to test, but redundancy has prevented countless highline accidents from becoming serious or fatal. Remember that the key to redundancy is that any one part of the system can fail without the whole system failing. What does it mean for the system to fail? It may mean different things depending on the situation, like on a low midline, where the whole system may be intact, but the system failed if a backup fall led to the slackliner hitting the deck. \n\n### Prevention of Cascading Failure\n\nAny split connection should prevent cascading failures as much as possible. A **cascading failure** occurs when the failure of one component leads to other components failing. \n\n![Double soft shackle Inov Split - side view](notes/images/ssInovSide.jpg) ![Double soft shackle Inov Split - top view](notes/images/ssInovTop.jpg)   \n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe \"Inov Split\" split system with two soft shackles. The knots of the soft shackles are tucked inside the sewn loops. In the classic Inov Split, the center soft shackle connecting the two backups is replaced by a quicklink. If the \"S\" shaped soft shackle were to fail, both mains would be out of the system leading to a double backup fall.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\nAn example of a split connection with cascading failures is the the classic Inov Split, where a soft shackle connects both mainlines in a figure eight pattern, and a quicklink connects both backups to the crossing strands of the soft shackle. The system is fully redundant, because no single piece failing leads to failure of the whole system. However, because the backup loops are not connected directly to the opposing side main loops, the system is set up for a cascading failure in the case of soft shackle failure. If the soft shackle fails, the line drops onto two backup segments, which is equivalent to both main segments failing. The failure of the soft shackle cascades through to the segments it was connecting, resulting in a large fall.\n\n![2 through 4 with two soft shackles - side view](notes/images/2through4side.jpg)                                                                                                                                                                                                   ![2 through 4 with two soft shackles - sidetop view](notes/images/2through4top.jpg)                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eThe \"through-all-four\" or \"two-through-four\" split system with two soft shackles. The knots of the soft shackles are tucked in the gap between the loops. The backups are tucked inside the main loops to act as thimbles, and are tucked from opposite sides to prevent rolling.\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\nTo see how this is avoidable, consider the \"through-all-four\" split system, where two soft shackles each go through all four (two main, two backup) sewn loops, often with the backup loops stacked inside the main loops. Both soft shackles share load, and connect to the same points in the system. Now if one soft shackle fails, nothing else in the system is affected. We have lost redundancy at the split, but nothing else has failed. Importantly, a large fall has been avoided, and redundancy has been preserved across both segments. \n\nAt its worst, a cascading failure means that one component failing leads to the whole system failing. Proper redundancy prevents this by ensuring that any one component of the system can fail without the system failing. But even with full redundancy, a cascading failure can turn a small mistake into a big mistake. Not only is falling onto two backup segments a serious risk of groundfall on many lines, but it now requires a rescue off of a line with two segments worth of lost redundancy. Cascading failures generally come with a cascading loss of redundancy, and in the conditions that are most likely to cause highline failures (adverse weather and user error), you want all of the redundancy you can get. Remember, most major accidents are the result of multiple bad decisions - do your best to insulate your bad decisions from each other.\n\n### Security\n\nThe security of a split connection refers to how securely attached the different webbing segments are. Can the connectors shake open under vibration, or be unintentionally opened if stepped on or hit during a leashfall? We all know a forged metal leash ring is a secure attachment for our leash to the webbing, but a carabiner is not. How do we evaluate the security of our different connection systems?\n\nQuicklinks are often thought to be the most secure connection method, perhaps due to the psychological effect of having a solid piece of metal in the system. But quicklinks are not a solid piece of metal. If a quicklink is not fully screwed shut, it can fail much lower than its rated force. It is best to think of a quicklink as being only as secure as the last turn of its closure. **If using quicklinks in split connections, always use a wrench to tighten them.** Even then, quicklinks have been known to fail on split connections due to the vibration of an extreme wind event. Some people will tape the closure of their quicklinks shut after wrench-tightening them to help prevent movement from vibration.\n\nSoft shackles are often seen as a less secure option for connections compared to quicklinks, but there are no documented cases of soft shackles opening when used in a split connection ([If you know of any, please file a SAIR report through the ISA](https://data.slacklineinternational.org/safety/report-incident/english/)). Like quicklinks, they can be taped shut by applying a small amount of tape at the noose. The most secure method for using soft shackles is most likely just keeping all soft shackles under tension, which can be achieved by a \"through-all-four system.\" Some people employ one of two different varieties of \"locking soft shackles,\" where either the noose or the knot is passed through the legs of the soft shackle before putting the noose over the knot, but it is unclear if there's any advantage to this method. \n\n![\"Through-all-four\" system with two grog splices - side view](notes/images/2grogsSide.jpg)                                  ![\"Through-all-four\" system with two grog splices - top view](notes/images/2grogsTop.jpg)                                    \n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eGrog splices used in a \"through all 4\" split system instead of soft shackles. Note the significantly reduced side profile. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n[Grog splices](notes/GrogSplices.md) appear to offer the best in security, as they are connected with a brummel splice, although more real world use is needed to confirm this. As they become more commonly used, we will know better if this reasoning is correct. Lock stitching the tail buries can make them almost perfectly secure, at the cost more time connecting and disconnecting. \n  \n### Minimization of Movement\n\nMovement in a split connection can't be fully avoided due to the dynamic nature of highlines, and it has been responsible for a numbers of failures on split highlines. Regular movement of the highline can cause a back and forth sawing motion that allows twisted backups, especially those made up of round dyneema backup extenders, to abrade into the mainline. High wind has caused multiple types of split failures, including shaking open quicklinks and causing a soft shackle to be cut by the webbing in a DLV (Dura-La-Vida) connection. During a backup fall, the rapid shift of tension has potential to create a significant amount of heat if there is movement within the split, as there is in many connection styles. We can't fully avoid movement in our highlines: in the case of wind and backup falls, we try our best to avoid them but can't guarantee that we will, and regular movement of the highline is a core part of why we highline. The best we can do is mitigate its effects by choosing good split setups.\n\nSplit setups should be chosen to avoid the potential for movement related failure modes like cutting, abrasion, and heat (vibration is another failure mode that is mostly an issue for quicklinks). The first step is to decrease the potential for explosive shifts during backup falls, as the fast shifts create potential for cutting and abrasion and can generate significant heat. Ideally, there is no difference in how the connectors are loaded during a backup fall. The Y2K system is a good example of very limited movement because as long as the backup connector is small enough, the two backup loops do not have the ability to move in the connection. The classic Inov Split has too much movement: because the backup connector is attached to a sliding x on a soft shackle, whichever mainline breaks is going to cause a shift in both the main soft shackle and the backup connector. \n\n![\"Dura La Vida\" split connection with quicklinks - side view](notes/images/DuraLaVidaSide.jpg)                                  \n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003e\"Dura La Vida\" connection with two quicklinks. Note the gap in the sewing on the right that allows significant back and forth motion. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\nBeyond just explosive movements during a backup fall, splits should minimize the possible movement in its \"standard\" configuration as well. The \"through-all-four\" split is the best at minimizing movement. Because everything in the split shares tension, there is little potential for extraneous movement. The shared tension also prevents explosive movements in a backup fall. The DLV split is particularly bad at minimizing movement due to its large size, required by the sewing. This extra space allows the connector to move back and forth freely, which is what caused the webbing in a DLV to cut the soft shackle in the incident mentioned above. Although this incident happened in heavy wind, it's possible for the same effect to happen during a backup fall. While quicklinks would not be cut by the webbing in these scenarios, it's possible for the quicklink to cut the webbing if it has any sharp edges, which is especially likely if the quicklink has partially opened.\n\n### Ease of Inspection\n\n\n![\"The W\" split connection method - side view](notes/images/theWside.jpg)\n![\"The W\" split connection method - top view](notes/images/theWtop.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003e\"The W\" split system with two soft shackles. \"The W\" allows offsetting the sewn loops by using a longer backup connector. The main connector soft shackle is doubled wrapped here to keep the loops close together. This split setup is not complicated once you know it, but is relatively hard to inspect when you see it the first time. \u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\nFollowing the tips discussed above will help you decide on a safe highline split setup. None of them, however, are foolproof against human error, and human error is the leading cause of fatal accidents in highlining. Making your splits easy to inspect will help you and anyone you rig with catch potentially catastrophic errors. Simple splits are easier to inspect, especially for people unfamiliar with your method of making connections. It should be easy to tell that both of your backups are connected to both mains and to see that each connector is going through the proper loop. Splits covered in sleeves or excessive tape can be difficult or impossible to inspect, and have a high potential for uncaught human error. For example, if you have taped a quicklink shut, it is no longer easy to tell if it has been wrenched closed without undoing the tape (if it is still easy to tell, the tape is not doing anything).\n\n![\"The W\" split connection method opened up - top view](notes/images/theWopenedTop.jpg)\n\u003cp align=\"center\"\u003e \u003cem\u003e\"The W\" split system with two soft shackles, opened to show its structure. The doubled soft shackle goes through both main loops, and the long backup shackle goes through all four loops. It is easy to inspect when laid out like this, although in practice it is normally taped up so this view cannot be seen. When making the W, it is best to construct it like this with both backups upside down, and then fold the backups towards the main to make the right-side up. This gives the backup shackle its \"W\" shape and keeps your webbing flat.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n  \n\n---\n\n\n## Use and Convenience Related Factors\n\n### Bulk\n\nSplits can add significant bulk to the otherwise continuous 1\" wide highlines we walk, which can catch your leashring while you walk, interrupting your flow and possibly your send. While a caught sewn loop while walking can be annoying, big splits also make rescues significantly more difficult and time consuming. While a Kootenay (knot passing pulley) can help mitigate this, they're rarely found at most rigs and still can be needlessly caught by a large split. Rescues are already a very time sensitive maneuver, and a large split only reduces your chance of a successful outcome. Large splits are also difficult to pass through z-drags, and trying to force a split through a z-drag while under tension can easily lead to injury. \n\nIn the past 2 years, slackline companies have started to make large (~3\" inner diameter) aluminum leashrings specifically designed to make walking past splits easier. However, even with big leashrings you can get snagged on an overly bulky split. With older style leashrings, a poorly made split can be almost impossible to pass. Keeping your splits slim in both directions perpendicular to the webbing will help your leashrings glide smoothly past while you walk. It's also important to setup your split so there are no protruding pieces to catch a ring, which can include tucking button knots inside the sewn loops or inverting the shackle so they point inwards, taping your backup loops to the main so the stiff stitching can't protrude, and taping the tab at the end of the stitching on both main and backup loops.\n\n### Weight\n\nSplits are generally significantly heavier than the webbing around them, which makes walking harder by changing the line dynamics and makes your whole rig heavier to carry. Heavy metal in a split can also seriously injure someone if they fall right at the split. Steel leashrings have been known to hit people in the face, breaking teeth and noses, and quicklinks in a split are just as capable of hurting someone in a fall. \n\nThe ideal split has the exact linear density, or weight per meter, of your main and backup webbing together. It is likely better to be too light than too heavy. Calculating this can be very difficult, as it requires knowing the exact weight of your sewn loops, and will differ across different webbings. It is useful as an ideal because it can help explain why saving a few dozen grams in your pack weight might not matter much, but saving that same weight out of your line might make a huge difference in how your line feels to walk.\n\n### Ease of Setup/Takedown\n\nIf you are connecting and disconnecting different webbings on site, it is beneficial to have connections that are fast and easy to make and take apart. Even if you've connected your webbing beforehand, you may end up changing them on site if you made a mistake like swapping the main and backup on a segment. Soft shackles are the easiest connector to do and undo, because they do not need a special tool to use. Both quicklinks and grog splices need special tools to make a connection (a wrench and a fid, respectively), and quicklinks will also need a tool to undo. While they are still relatively quick to connect (see [splicing grogs on site](notes/SplicingGrogsOnSite.md)), they won't be if you're trying to makeshift a tool at the anchor. In addition to your connectors, it is important you are familiar with your split style and have practice making it. Trying to remember which connector goes where while stressed at the anchor is not ideal for a few reasons, speed only being one of them.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-17T19:21:36.146540477Z","tags":null},"/notes/FarmerBoyFullBreakTest":{"title":"Farmer Boy 5mm Diamond Braid Full Break Tests","content":"# Complete Farmer Boy Diamond Braid Breaktests \n\n## Main Test \n\nBelow are the full 56 break tests of [Farmer Boy 5mm diamond braid polyester cord](https://farmerboyag.com/unicord-diamond-braid-rope-3-16-in-dia-x-1000-ft-l-polyester/). The first 40 tests were measured with a LineScale 2 on Peak Fast mode, with soft shackles connecting directly to the dynamometer. Tension was pulled by a single person per test on a 15:1 pulley system with 3\" SMC pulleys. Samples were between 2 and 3 meters long, and had a figure 8 knot terminating any end not being tested (on both sides for the bend tests, on one side for the device tests). The final 16 tests were done on Balance Community's break test machine, reading at 500 Hz, which Jerry Miszewski generously let us use for testing.\n\nThe cord in this test was about 2 years old and heavily used. Offcuts with notable abrasion spots were avoided where possible, although there was likely significant variation in wear across different test samples. The cord was broken because it was deemed due for retirement, and so represents conservative strength values for used cord. \n\nFor full discussion of Farmer Boy, see [the main post](notes/FarmerBoyKnotsDevices.md).\n \n\n| Break Type | Sample Number | Breaking Strength (kN) | Comments |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 8 to 8 | 1 | 2.21 | Broke in middle |\n| 8 to 8 | 2 | 2.44 | Broke in middle |\n| 8 to 8 | 3 | 2.20 | Broke in middle |\n| Alpine Butterfly Bend | 1 | 2.10 | Broke at knot |\n| Alpine Butterfly Bend | 2 | 2.18 | Broke at knot |\n| Alpine Butterfly Bend | 3 | 2.4 | Broke at knot |\n| Double Sheet Bend (Yosemite Finish) | 1 | 2.22 | Broke at knot |\n| Double Sheet Bend (Yosemite Finish) | 2 | 1.98 | Broke at knot |\n| Double Sheet Bend (Yosemite Finish) | 3 | 2.14 | Broke at knot |\n| Releasable Double Sheet Bend | 1 | 2.15 | Broke at knot |\n| Zeppelin Bend | 1 | 2.19 | Broke at knot |\n| Zeppelin Bend | 2 | 2.02 | Broke at knot |\n| Zeppelin Bend | 3 | 2.11 | Broke at knot |\n| Micro Trax | 1 | 1.76 |  |\n| Micro Trax | 2 | 1.54 |  |\n| Micro Trax | 3 | 1.51 |  |\n| Doubled Micro Trax | 1 | 2.28 |  |\n| Doubled Micro Trax | 2 | 2.38 |  |\n| Doubled Micro Trax | 3 | 2.15 |  |\n| Mini Trax | 1 | 1.76 |  |\n| Mini Trax | 2 | 1.54 |  |\n| Mini Trax | 3 | 1.51 |  |\n| Doubled Mini Trax | 1 | 2.16 |  |\n| Doubled Mini Trax | 2 | 2.24 |  |\n| Doubled Mini Trax | 3 | 2.01 |  |\n| Roll N Lock | 1 | 1.94 |  |\n| Roll N Lock | 2 | 1.91 |  |\n| Roll N Lock | 3 | 2.13 |  |\n| Doubled Roll N Lock | 1 | 1.93 | Broke notably lower than single wrapped |\n| Doubled Roll N Lock | 2 | 1.79 | Broke notably lower than single wrapped |\n| Doubled Roll N Lock | 3 | 1.82 | Broke notably lower than single wrapped |\n| Handled Ascender | 1 | 1.06 |  |\n| Handled Ascender | 2 | 1.13 |  |\n| Handled Ascender | 3 | 1.24 |  |\n| Chained Handled Ascenders | 1 | 1.66 | 2 in line connected by carabiner |\n| Chained Handled Ascenders | 2 | 1.69 | 2 in line connected by carabiner |\n| Chained Handled Ascenders | 3 | 1.79 | 2 in line connected by carabiner |\n| Tibloc | 1 | 0.99 | Slips, tearing outside | \n| Tibloc | 2 | 1.79* | Slips, tearing outside - this test likely loaded the backup rope, leading to artificially high result| \n| Tibloc | 3 | 1.00 | Slips, tearing outside | \n| Capstan to Capstan | 1 | 4.39 |  |\n| Capstan to Capstan | 2 | 4.04 |  |\n| Capstan to Capstan | 3 | 4.22 |  |\n| Duck | 1 | 2.44 |  |\n| Duck | 2 | 2.46 |  |\n| Duck | 3 | 2.57 |  |\n| Ropeman 1 | 1 | 2.11 | Minor Slippage |\n| Ropeman 1 | 2 | 1.78 | Slipped around 1.6 |\n| Ropeman 1 | 3 | 1.96 |  |\n| Spoc | 1 | 2.41 |  |\n| Spoc | 2 | 2.39 | Desheathed then broke |\n| Spoc | 3 | 2.33 |  |\n| Nite Ize CamJam XT | 1 | 2.87 |  |\n| Nite Ize CamJam XT | 2 | 2.74 | Slipped before breaking | \n| Nite Ize CamJam XT | 3 | 2.80 | Broke at 8 knot | \n| 4 Wrap Prusik | 3 | 1.26 | Made of Farmer Boy, Slips | \n\n\n\n## Other Known Testing - Alonso's Test Videos\nAlonso's Figure 8 tests show values as high as 3.10 kN for 5mm diamond braid, indicating either that he was using a different brand of cord, or that his cord was less used than mine. My best guess is that my cord was simply more used than his. In the capstan tests, my cord tested as high as 4.04 kN, indicating higher \"true\" breaking strength in the middle, less used sections of cord. In the devices tested, our results are roughly similar, with minimum values with about .1 kN, or about 5%, across tests. It appears the breaking strength in devices was not highly affected by the wear on the cord. \n\nHis tests are spread out across two videos, both below.

It is often called Farmer Boy because it is sold by Farmer Boy Ag. It is relatively large diameter, but relatively low strength. The product page lists its tensile strength as both 650 lbs (2.9 kN) and 800 lbs (3.6 kN), although 650 lbs is more accurate given the test results on it. Additional testing showed values of over 900 lbs (4.0 kN), which may indicate the more used seciton tested first was weaker, or strength was suffering more in the figure 8 knots than we had thought. It is often used to tag long highlines, but has also failed on a few highlines. \n\nWhile at the Paradise highline spot near Durango, Colorado, we performed 40 break tests in Farmer Boy cord in various knots and devices. We focused on common connecting knots like the sheet bend and alpine butterfly bend, as well as toothed and camming progress capture devices. Supplemental testing was done using Balance Community's break test machine on an additional 16 samples.\n\nThe goal of this testing is to give proven values for strength in this cord in common tagging situations. Hopefully it can help in the planning stage of projects, when deciding where Farmer Boy is a good fit to use as tag, and to help calculate safety ratio when able to measure forces while tagging. \n\n### Why use Farmer Boy?\n\nFarmer Boy is popular for a number of reasons. First of all, it is quite cheap, with each 300 meter spool costing only $37 USD at the time of writing. It is mostly used as an alternative to 550 paracord. It is about 100 lbs (0.44 kN) stronger than paracord according to its stated tensile strength, and it is roughly 1mm larger in diameter. The extra diameter means it is easier to grab by hand, and performs better in toothed and camming devices not meant for small diameter cord. \n\nIts main disadvantages compared to paracord are its weight (roughly double, although no weight is published for Farmer Boy and I don't currently have access to a scale to determine its weight) and it's increased packed size.\n\n### Tagline Forces from Paradise Mile Project\n\nThe impetus to test Farmer Boy came from our use of it while tagging the US Mile Project at Paradise. Both the walking gap and sight line were tagged first with FPV drones connected to 300 lb (1.3 kN) braided dyneema fishing line. For the sight line gap, the fishing line was used to pull over Farmer Boy directly, and the Farmer Boy was used to pull across the sight line, which was a mix of various cords with windsocks every 30-60m for most of the gap. For the walking gap, the braided fishing line first pulled 450m of 550 paracord to reduce the total weight, then 1 mile of Farmer Boy, which was then used to pull a [6mm pull rope](https://sgtknots.com/products/double-braided-polyester-pulling-rope) (12 kN, 28 g/m). The pull rope will be used to pull the webbing across. \n\nWhile the Farmer Boy was pulling in the pull rope, it was first redirected through a high kootenay pulley, down to a cluster of trees, and then through two more trees where it was hauled in by hand. There was a LineScale 2 dynamometer at the first cluster of trees attached to a rollerbiner, then the line went through a Petzl Mini Trax at the next tree, was slightly redirected through a Rollex at the next tree, and finally went through a Petzl Micro Trax at the final tree. Pulling was done caterpillar style between the Rollex and Micro Trax, and behind the Micro Trax. The second progress capture device was used to decrease the amount of force differential carried by the teeth of the first progress capture. The first progress capture was also placed after the first two redirects so the friction in those redirects would decrease the total force seen by the progress capture. \n\nWhile pulling the pull rope in with the Farmer Boy, the ideal tension read by the dyno was about 0.9 kN, with spikes up to 1.2 kN in wind or when the pull rope wasn't being released fast enough compared to the pulling speed. The dyno was at a redirect that we estimated to be 30 degrees, which we took to mean the force being read by the dyno was somehwat less than twice the force being seen by the Farmer Boy. We estimated it on site as being 1.5 times the force on the Farmer Boy, but if our angle estimation was correct, it should be closer to 1.9 times the force on the Farmer Boy, giving us a peak of roughly 0.6 kN. Because we were worried about the force in the Mini Trax, and in the handled ascenders used to pass knots, we were not worried about the force change due to the first kootenay redirect. The break test values below show that in both the Mini Trax and the two chained handled ascenders, we had plenty of safety ratio in our forces (roughly 3x safety factor). This shows Farmer Boy can be a suitable intermediary tagline for lines up to 1 mile long, at a price of roughly $200 USD. \n\n## Interpretation\n\nThe used cord broke consistently around 2.2 kN, which is approximately 75% of its rated strength. Although all of the bends broke at the knot, they broke at roughly 2.0 kN at the lowest, which is roughly 70% of rated strength and 90% of used strength. All of the bends tested seem suitable for use in tagging, although the alpine bend had some minor (but maybe not significant) strength advantage. \n\nOf the toothed and camming devices, the Petzl Mini Trax and CT Roll N Lock did significantly better (1.9kN, roughly 85% of used strength) than the Micro Trax (1.5kN, roughly 70% of used strength) when single wrapped. When doubled, the Mini Trax and Micro Trax both improved significantly. The Mini Trax improved up to 2.0 kN, and the Micro Trax up to 2.15, almost 100% of the used strength. The Roll N Lock actually got slightly worse when double wrapped, breaking at 1.8 kN or roughly 80% of used strength. This seems to be due to a sharp V shape in the cam of the Roll N Lock that can't accommodate two layers of cord as well. Due to the addition of twists and the increased difficulty of passing knots in double wrapped cords, it appears using a Petzl Mini Trax or CT Roll N Lock single wrapped is the best solution tested for progress capture in this cord. \n\nIf a handled ascender needs to be used on Farmer Boy, or it needs to be grabbed inline in some way, chaining two handled ascenders together with a carabiner (through the top of one into the handle of the other) works quite well at about 1.66 kN or 75% of used line strength. Both the Petzl Tibloc and the single handled ascender did the worst in the test, at about 1 kN or 45% of used strength. Chaining two handled ascenders is thus a major benefit if needing pass a knot, although it is not as strong as the best progress captures.\n\n### Update\n\nIn additional testing the capstan to capstan breaking value was just over 4 kN, indicating either that the cord was weaker at the ends where testing began and it had undergone more use, or that the figures 8s were influencing the breaking values more than had been thought. It is also possible the difference in break test method made up the difference, either through different calibration of the dynamometers or differences in pulling speed. \n\nThe Edelrid Spoc (2.33 kN) and Kong Duck (2.44 kN) each performed at near full strength compared to the original 8 to 8 tests. If these results reflect the performance of the devices rather than differences in testing sessions, the Spoc would outperform both the Mini and Micro Traxes, and the Duck would outperform the Roll N Lock. The Ropeman 1 from Wild Country did significantly worse than the other non-toothed camming devices, perhaps indicating the strength tests from this batch were not artifically inflated.\n\nTwo other unique progress captures were tested. The first is the CamJam XT from Nite Ize, an aluminum carabiner and progress capture available at very low cost ($16) from many hardware stores. The large version was tested here, which is rated for 1500 lbs (6.67 kN). It says \"MAX LOAD 500 LBS\" on the side of the device but this is it's WLL. It broke the cord at 2.74 kN, and in one test the cord broke at the figure 8 before breaking in the cam. This is quite impressive, and suggests Farmer Boy cord and the CamJam XT are a tempting budget option for tagging highlines. It does come with a few drawbacks though. It has no bearings or rolling surface of any kind, meaning pulling with it will be less efficient. Also, the way the device is loaded means the tag can't be pulled without making a 180 degree turn through the device. Finally, the device isn't rated for life-bearing use, meaning it should not be used in rescues. Many of the other progress captures are suitable for a light and handy rescue setup, as shown [in this video from the ISA.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pbMM6Cuz5M)\n\nThe other unique progress capture tested was a 4 wrap prusik hitch made of Farmer Boy. The hitch was made of Farmer Boy because friction hitches often work best with matching diameter cord. While this would be a cheap and easy progress capture method, it slipped at 1.26 kN, and continued to slip at under 1 kN until the test was stopped. \n\n### Why not 3 sigma MBS? \n\nThe results given below represent the lowest break test from a sample of 3 for each type of test (except for the releasable sheet bend which was tested only once). The lowest tested strength is given rather than the 3 sigma calculated Minimum Breaking Strength (MBS), because of the low sample number, and the fact that tests were completed with a pulley system and on used cord. All of these would contribute to a high variance, giving a deceptively low MBS. It is also questionable whether 3 sigma MBS is appropriate for non life support soft goods. \n\nI believe testing well used cord with a pulley system simulates the real use conditions of this cord well, and should provide a conservative strength figure for the cord in use. \n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe Kong Duck appears to perform the best of all of the progress captures in 5mm Farmer Boy cord, breaking at 2.44 kN. The Edelrid Spoc is the best of the toothed devices, perhaps due to the smaller channel in the pulley and smaller gap between the pulley and teeth. Both are moderately cheaper than their closest competitors (the Roll N Lock for the Duck, and the Micro Trax for the Spoc). It is possible the high strength values of these devices was skewed by the differences across testing sessions.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that performance of any progress capture will vary significantly between different diameters and constructions of cord, so these results do not generalize to different taglines. Testing of different taglines in these devices is coming soon.\n\n## Results\n\nFor full break test results, see [Farmer Boy Full Break Tests](notes/FarmerBoyFullBreakTest.md).\n\n| Break Type | Sample Number | Breaking Strength (kN) | Comments |\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 8 to 8 | 3 | 2.20 | Broke in middle |\n| Alpine Butterfly Bend | 1 | 2.10 | Broke at knot |\n| Double Sheet Bend (Yosemite Finish) | 2 | 1.98 | Broke at knot |\n| Releasable Double Sheet Bend | 1 | 2.15 | Broke at knot |\n| Zeppelin Bend | 2 | 2.02 | Broke at knot |\n| Micro Trax | 3 | 1.51 |  |\n| Doubled Micro Trax | 3 | 2.15 |  |\n| Mini Trax | 3 | 1.51 |  |\n| Doubled Mini Trax | 3 | 2.01 |  |\n| Roll N Lock | 2 | 1.91 |  |\n| Doubled Roll N Lock | 2 | 1.79 | Broke notably lower than single wrapped |\n| Handled Ascender | 1 | 1.06 |  |\n| Chained Handled Ascenders | 1 | 1.66 | 2 in line connected by carabiner |\n| Tibloc | 1 | 0.99 | Slips, tearing outside | \n| Capstan to Capstan | 2 | 4.04 |  |\n| Duck | 1 | 2.44 |  |\n| Ropeman 1 | 2 | 1.78 | Slipped around 1.6 |\n| Spoc | 2 | 2.33 |  |\n| Nite Ize CamJam XT | 2 | 2.74 | Slipped before breaking | \n| 4 Wrap Prusik | 3 | 1.26 | Made of Farmer Boy, Slips | \n\n### Edits\nI will be trying to keep this page up to date with feedback and new information, and will keep track of edits as I make them here.\n1.

After that point we switched from attaching grogs at the pin to attaching them at the bow. \n\n## Preliminary Tests\nBefore the main tests above, three different preliminary tests were done. These are discussed below. These tests are all characterized by low sample numbers and a lack of controls.\n\n### First Tests \nI first tested grog splices with Jerry in August of 2021, again in the Balance Community workshop. We tested three grogs, two I had premade and one I made on site. All were 5mm dyneema, but unfortunately we did not measure the bury lengths. One of the premade grogs was made of used dyneema from a Snatch whose splice had failed. That test failed the lowest. Oddly, the other two values are quite a bit higher than normal when compared to the larger testing done a year later on the same test machine. \n\n| Bury Size | Breaking Strength (kN) |\n| :-: | :-: |\n| ? | 28 | \n| ? | 37 |\n| ? | 34 |\n\n![Two broken grogs from first testing](/notes/images/JerryTest1.jpeg)\n![One broken grog from first testing](/notes/images/JerryTest2.jpeg)\n\n### Parking Lot Tests\nBefore first using the grogs I had made at the Fruit Bowl for Halloween 2021, we decided to try break testing them in the parking lot to make sure the 4\" bury size I had chosen was sufficient. We pulled the grogs between a van and a large pickup truck, using a Linescale 2 to read the values. We were able to pull up to 21.5 kN, which convinced us they were safe enough to rig at the festival. We could not break a 4\" bury grog, but we experimented with unburying one or both tails to see if we oculd force a failure. Using both tails unburied causes the brummel to invert and fail at extremely low forces. We didn't get a good reading, but it was nearly immediate. With only one of the two tails buried, the dyneema in the unburied tail fully unravels causing the brummel to come undone and the loop to fail around 15 kN. One tail appears to be slightly stronger than the other.\n\nHere is an inverted brummel from not burying either tail:\n\n![Inverted brummel](notes/images/undone_brummel.jpeg)\n\nHere is a fully unwoven tail from burying only one tail:\n![Unwoven brummel tail](notes/images/unwoven_dyneema.jpeg)\n\n\n### Jake's Scale Testing\nJake Monaghan heard about using grogs and wanted to test, but only had access to a pulley system. So he used 7/64\" dyneema in hopes of being able to scale up the test results to 5mm dyneema. His findings are below. \n\n![Jakes Test Results](/notes/images/JakesGrogTest.jpeg)\n\n\n### Edits\nI will be trying to keep this page up to date with feedback and new information, and will keep track of edits as I make them here.\n1.

They offer numerous advantages over existing highlines split connections, and are the first connector to facilitate semi-permanent connections. This method has been in testing for a year, and this article aims to be exhaustive with everything currently known about grogs and split highlines. \n\nSemi-permanent connections are weird based on the current paradigm of soft shackle and quicklink connections. They might challenge some existing notions about highline splits, but their benefits are worth a shift in mindset. So what is a grog, how do you make one, how strong are they, and where should I use them? Keep reading to learn all there is to know about grog splices.\n\n![Grog split used in a rig](notes/images/grogsplit1.jpeg)\n\n## What is a Grog?\nA grog is a method of splicing a continuous loop of braided material that makes use of a brummel splice, but buries each tail back into the working strand on the side it came from. Here is the [animated knots page for the grog sling](https://www.animatedknots.com/grog-sling-knot), which has good pictures and some discussion of grogs (some of the discussion does not match the testing found below, or the first hand experience I have of using grogs while slacklining).\n\nOur particular interest in grogs is as a connection method in highline splits, replacing soft shackles and quicklinks. If you're just interested in how they can be an improvement over other connection options, skip to *Benefits of the Grog* below. But if you'd like a deeper dive into how and why the idea for using them came about, keep reading here. \n\n### Origins\nTo my knowledge, grogs were first used in slacklining as the manufacturer recommended way of re-splicing the Souz Snatch, which was originally shipped with a weak splice that had a tendency of fully unraveling during normal use. \n\nBut the idea of using them in split connections first appeared in discussions between me and Owen Roll. I had been making a lot of variations of continuous loops in dyneema, and showed Owen some of the variations I had tried splicing. I had deemed them useless for splits because they don't open like a soft shackle, but Owen convinced me of the benefits. Fairly quickly we seemed to settle on the grog as being the best continuous loop method for the job. Sirio Zao made a [post on SlackChat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slackchat/posts/5048334728573697/) asking about use of a grog in splits in combination with a soft shackle before Owen and I shared our idea publicly, and no one seemed to have used them previously or been convinced to try them.\n\nThe first use of them in a split was by Jerry Miszewski on a 200m permarig in the fall of 2021, after I brought the idea to him and we break tested some I had made. I rigged lines with them at the Halloween Fruitbowl Gathering and GGBY, also in the fall of 2021, along with some other rigs. Jerry's line had 5mm grogs with 6\" buries and lock stitching on one side. My lines used 5mm grogs with 3-4\" buries and no lock stitching, and even rigged for days at a time at a festival saw no problems with the buries coming undone. The grogs were exceptionally easy to walk over, easy to splice and unsplice, and apparently safe enough. But I waited until now to share the grog in order to make sure I tested them fully before advocating them to the general public. \n\n### Semi-Permanent Split Connections\nOne of the main benefits of split connections is the ability to connect and disconnect separate pieces of webbing, instead of needing two long pieces of webbing capable of spanning the whole gap. Doesn't splicing a continuous loop through your webbing negate the adjustability of your split rig? It would, if these splices were permanent, but they aren't. \n\nGrog splices are semi-permanent, but not permanent. They can be left in place for a long time, but easily removed and reused at will. It takes me roughly five minutes to connect two highline segments with grogs, and about a minute to take them apart after they've been tensioned. I've done this at home and right at the anchor, which shows that field splicing with grogs is doable for someone who is used to making them. \n\nAlso, if you own a long rig, it is easy to pre-splice your segments in a smart way to give you optimal flexibility across different webbing lengths. For example, if you own six 50m highline segments, you can connect three 50m segments in one bag, two 50m segments in another bag, and leave the final 50m segment in its own bag. For any line up to 150m, you have a bag already packed with no need to make any connections. From 150-250m, you have to combine 2 bags with one split either at home or on site. For lines from 250-300m, you have to make 2 connections at home or on site. In all of these cases you have full flexibility, with minimal need to make connections for a specific rig. You also maintain the safety benefits of a split rig in every case, without having the hassle of making up to 5 connections while packing for a rig.\n\n### Continuous Loops in Dyneema\nWhy use a grog instead of another method of making a continuous loop? You can read all about some different ways of making continuous loops [at the sailing website L-36](https://l-36.com/loop.php), but even this isn't an exhaustive source. Like soft shackles, there are many ways of accomplishing the same thing with different strengths and trade offs. The primary reason for choosing a grog for split connections is having a secure splice (thanks to the brummel) without having to lock stitch. Lock stitching is relatively more difficult and time consuming than splicing, and slackliners might either be put off by the annoyance or be tempted to skip the lock stitch (risking full failure of the splice). Plus, lock stitching would require the loops to be more permanent than semi-permanent. I have not been able to find any information of the grog alternative mentioned at Animated Knots called the \"Brion Toss re-braided Brummel technique,\" so I can't compare that here.\n\n## Benefits of the Grog\n\n![Sleekness of grog](/notes/images/grogsplit2.jpeg) \n\n1. **Size:** Grogs are small. Two 5mm grogs at a split is roughly the size of one 5mm soft shackle, *without the button knot.* This means they add minimal bulk, and are extremely easy for leash rings to pass. \n2. **Weight:** One 5mm grog splice with 4\" buries weighs about 7.6g. A small 5mm soft shackle weights about 15.9g. An 8mm camp stainless steel quickink weights 76g. This means in addition to being about the size of one soft shackle without the button knot, two grogs also weigh less than one soft shackle. Two grogs also weigh one fifth of a single 8mm quicklink. While walking, this translates to less wobble and shake from the splits and a more continuous feel across the line. It is also less weight in the bag. \n3. **Security:** Because they are spliced shut, as long as the tails remain buried, grogs cannot open. Unlike soft shackles, they do not need to be taped shut. Unlike quicklinks, they do not need to be torqued with a wrench. Once spliced, they only need a simple visual inspection that the tails are buried before being sent out.\n4. **No tape:** Grogs do not need a noose or screw taped shut. They do not have button knots that need to be taped in place to keep from grabbing the leash ring. You may still want to tape your sewn loops or other parts of your split, but the connections themselves need no tape. This means less waste from connecting and disconnecting segments, and a connection that remains visually inspectable throughout the rig.\n5. **Easy to walk over:** Grogs are extremely easy to walk over. Their small size is part of this, but they also make a closed loop that is very stable. That means they won't twist, and feel fine to step directly on. No more problems at the split ruining your flow. \n\n## How to make a Grog\nBelow are written instructions on how to make a grog splice. Pictures of each step can be found at the [animated knots page for the grog sling](https://www.animatedknots.com/grog-sling-knot).\n1. Cut length of dyneema\n\t- Proper lengths are given in the table below\n\t- Simply cut ends at a 45 degree angle, no taper necessary\n2. Measure back from ends\n\t- Measure back one bury length from each end\n\t- Add a little padding to account for the size of the brummel (one side might need more padding than the other, try making a few and you'll see what I mean here)\n\t- Make a hole in each end of the dyneema at the distance you've marked (bury length + extra for brummel)\n3. Make brummel\n\t- Make sure the holes you made in the last step split the dyneema evenly: there should be 6 strands of dyneema on each side of the hole\n\t- Pass strand A through the hole in strand B, until the hole in strand A has gone through the hole in strand B\n\t- Then pass strand B through the hole in strand A\n\t- Pull the tail of both strands to cinch the brummel\n4. Bury the tails\n\t- Make sure each tail has at least your bury length coming out of the brummel\n\t- Bury each tail back in the same direction as it comes out of the brummel, beginning the bury as close to the brummel as possible\n\n**Lengths of dyneema needed for different bury lengths in 5mm grogs:**\n\n| Bury Size Inches | Inches of Dyneema Needed | Bury Size mm | mm of Dyneema Needed |  \n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 4\" | 20 | 102 | 508 |\n| 5\" | 25 | 127 | 635 |\n| 6\" | 29 | 152 | 737 |\n\nThese lengths should leave approximately one inch between the buried tails. This makes it significantly easier to splice, especially in sewn loops, and also avoids making a much longer grog than necessary.\n\n**Bury length is key:** Make sure your bury length is **at least 4 inches** when measured from the ends of the brummel. This is the minimum size needed to get reliable strength. Buries that are far too short (less than 3 inches) will slip out well before the brummel breaks, opening the sling. \n\n**Are tapered tails necessary?:** No tapers necessary, grogs tend to break at the brummel, not at the end of the buries. When they do break at the end of the buries, it's not any weaker than other tests, so adding tapers wouldn't add to their strength. Just cut your dyneema ends at a 45 degree angle. \n\n## Breaktests\nDisclaimer: the breaktests were performed at the Balance Community workshop using their breaktest machine, and with the assistance of Balance Community founder Jerry Miszewski. \nSee the full breaktests at [the complete breaktest page](notes/GrogSpliceFullBreakTest) (some additional testing data is also included there). All tests were performed on Amsteel Blue.\n\n![26 Broken Grog Splices](notes/images/GrogBreaks.jpg)\n\n### Determining MBS\nTo determine an MBS for the grogs, I've decided to run the MBS calculations on all of the tests with bury lengths 4\" or greater. This includes 15 break tests. I've excluded the used grogs, as well as one test where a 5\" bury grog got caught in the screw of the shackle pin and tore apart at 27.2 kN. \n\nThis gives us a three sigma MBS of 24.5 kN. For those who don't know, the three sigma MBS is calculated by subtracting three standard deviations of the data from the mean, and in theory represents the value that ~99.7% of all samples will break at or above. This is the strict standard that climbing and slackline gear is typically held to.\n\nIt is important to note the mean across the 15 samples is quite higher than the three sigma MBS at 31.0 kN. The reason the MBS is so low is because of the high variance in the data. The weakest grog in the sample set was 27.3 kN, the strongest was 35.9 kN (both had 4\" buries). This relatively large difference between weakest and strongest means a large standard deviation, and thus a more conservative three sigma MBS in relation to the mean. \n\n| Bury Size (in) | Three Sigma MBS (kN) | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 4 - 6 | 24.5 | 31.0 | 27.3 | \n\n### Are Longer Buries Better?\nI advocate that **4 inches if the minimum bury length for a 5mm grog splice.** But is going longer better? As mentioned above, 4\" grogs had the weakest test of all the 4\", 5\", and 6\" buries we tested at 27.3 kN. But they also had the strongest at 35.9 kN. We tested 6 4\" grogs, 2 5\" grogs (if you exclude the one that got caught in the shackle pin), and 3 6\" grogs. Due to the very high value of 35.9 kN, I believe the higher variance in 4\" grogs is simply an artifact of testing twice as many. More testing would be needed to confirm or deny that, though. \n\nBelow are the values for just 6\" grogs, for people who would rather use a longer bury. Note that the mean breaking strength is the same, but the three sigma MBS and lowest tested value are much higher.\n\n| Bury Size (in) | Three Sigma MBS (kN) | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 6 | 29.9 | 31.0 | 30.6 | \n\n### Smaller Bury Grogs\nTo show that **4\" in the minimum bury length,** here is the testing we did with smaller bury length grogs. The one 2\" bury grog we tested came undone at 21.4 kN. The tails slipped out of their buries and the brummel rolled open, so the loop came undone before the dyneema broke. This is the only test where this happened, and we didn't see a need to test more 2\" buries.\n\nThe 3\" buries all broke in the dyneema, but at notably lower values. Using 4\" buries gives higher strength, and helps ensure that slight errors in splicing don't lead to the loop coming undone. \n\n| Bury Size (in) | Three Sigma MBS (kN) | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 3 | 22.0 | 26.7 | 25.5 | \n\n### Grog Inside or Outside?\nGrogs can be installed one of two ways: with the brummel splice facing either inside, towards the center of the loop, or outside, away from the center of the loop. Grogs are made in the \"outside\" configuration, and can simply be rolled half a rotation to be used in the \"inside\" configuration. We tested 3 4\" grogs in both configurations, both for completeness, and because it was suggested (by Jake Monaghan) that the buries may be less likely to work their way out when configured inside. Practical testing hasn't showed any problem with buries working their way out, even on a permarig left for 8 months (one bury was lock stitched but the other was not - neither showed any signs of movement), so security of the buried tails doesn't seem to be an issue.\n\n| Bury Size (in) | Grog Inside or Outside | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 4 | Outside | 31.6 | 27.3 | \n| 4 | Inside | 30.6 | 29.0 | \n\nHaving the grog outside had a higher mean but also a much higher variance (both the high and low were in this set), so a three sigma calculation would be much lower for this set. Having the grog inside had a lower mean but much lower variance. My interpretation of this is that there is no significant difference between the two ways of orienting the grog.\n\n### Used Grogs\nWe also tested a few used grogs. We tested one each of a 3\" and 4\" bury that I used at a few festivals and a few other rigs. These were noticeably worn, and had been spliced and unspliced a number of times. We also tested two 6\" bury grogs that had been left on Jerry's 200m permarig for 8 months in Colorado at about 7000' elevation. \n\nThe one 3\" bury tested fairly low at 20.8 kN. The 4\" bury used in the same split broke at 27.8 kN, which is within the normal range for new 4\" buries. The two 6\" buries broke at 26.4 and 34.2 kN, which is again a high variance, but shows that grogs handle UV well and maintain their safety when left up for 8 months or less. The 6\" buries had been respliced only once to redo them for testing. \n\n| Bury Size (in) | Mean Breaking Strength (kN) | Minimum Tested Value (kN)\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| 3-6 | 27.3 | 20.8 | \n\n### Further testing\nSome more testing data is shown on the complete breaktest page. Due to the high variances of grogs, more testing would be beneficial to understand the range of values we could expect. It would also be beneficial to test how much grogs weaken sewn loops compared to soft shackles and quicklinks. For now, it is probably best to continue using soft thimbles with grogs as you would with soft shackles.\n\nFurther testing is also needed with both larger and smaller diameter dyneema. 6mm grogs could be a great way of adding strength without a significant bulk increase for people who desire more strength from each individual sling. But the bury lengths for these tests do not apply, and similar tests will have to be repeated to find the sufficient bury length for full strength 6mm grogs. Similarly, some people will want to try 4mm double wrapped grogs as they have 4mm double wrapped soft shackles. More testing is required to see how the splices react to being double wrapped, and how sewn loops respond when loaded with such small diameters. In general, choice of diameter in grogs is more flexible than in soft shackles, since there is no button knot to add or subtract bulk. However, bury lengths and strengths will need to be determined for whatever diameter is being used - so far only 5mm grogs can be advocated for.\n\n## How and Where to Use Grogs\nKnowing their benefits and their breaking strength, how and where should you use grogs in your split connections? While an individual 5mm grog is significantly weaker than either a 5mm soft shackle or 8mm quicklink, two 5mm grogs are roughly the same strength as both while also being smaller and lighter. Therefore, my guideline would be **replace any single soft shackle or quicklink with two grogs.** For example, on a Y2K or Dura-La-Vida style connection where offset loops are generally connected with 1 quicklink or soft shackle each, use two grogs in place of each single connector. By using grogs in these cases, you gain a significant increase in redundancy while maintaining strength, and decreasing size and weight.\n\n![Example of through-all-four connection with grogs](/notes/images/grogsplit3.jpeg)\n\nHowever, there are also places where we use two connectors for redundancy, even though the strength of one connector is plenty. An example of this is when we put two soft shackles through both main and backup loops, with the backup loops tucked inside the main loops (through-all-four style connection). Here, two grogs sharing load should be roughly 50 kN strong, which is stronger than almost any webbing. And because there are two separate grogs, they are still redundant. For this reason, you can **replace two soft shackles that connect the same pieces of webbing with two grogs.** This gives you a connection that is plenty strong enough, and half the size and weight. \n\nIn general, any split connection can be done with two grogs, as long as there is not a failure mode of the webbing where one grog will be loaded on its own. \n\n## Conclusion\nGrog splices offer significant advantages over other connectors used in split highlines. They are smaller, lighter, and are significantly better to walk on and past than other connectors. When used in pairs, they maintain all of these advantages while also matching strength and adding redundancy. They are easily adapted to the most common split styles (4 simple loops, Y2K, and DLV) and can offer some advantage over the current standard in every case. They are relatively quick to install (about 5 minutes to splice two grogs) either at home or in the field, and are even quicker to remove (about 1 minute to remove two loaded grogs). If you're not convinced, try walking a line with them.\n\nI've tried to make this an exhaustive list of everything we know about grogs, but if you have additional questions reach out and I will try to answer them. \n\n### Grog Links\nBelow is a list of the other articles I've made regarding grogs, that I will try to keep updated as I go.\n1.

The tests were done on Balance Community's break test machine, reading at 500 Hz, which Jerry Miszewski generously let us use for testing. Samples were between 2 and 3 meters long, and had a figure 8 knot terminating any end not being tested (on both sides for the bend tests, on one side for the device tests). \n\nThe cord in this test was about 1 year old and moderately used, although it showed a decent amount of wear on its sheath. Offcuts with notable abrasion spots were avoided where possible, although there was likely significant variation in wear across different test samples. The cord was broken because it had snapped in a progress capture during the tagging of the US Mile record attempt. It was donated by Vova Kozlov to allow testing for future projects and a better understanding of the failure during the mile tagging.\n\nFor full discussion of Pull Rope, see [the main

Braid Polyester Cord in Knots and Devices\n\n![Collection of progress captures tested](notes/images/ProgressCaptures.jpeg)\n\n## Introduction \n\n[Double Braid 6mm Pull Rope from SGT Knots](https://sgtknots.com/products/double-braided-polyester-pulling-rope) is a high strength and relatively inexpensive tagline that has been used as the final tagline for a number of 500m+ projects in the US over the past few years. It is rated for 2700 lbs (12 kN) and costs roughly $220 for 375m of tag. One of its main advantages is it comes with spliced ends, commonly believed to be full strength, which negates the strength reduction due to knots that other taglines suffer from.\n\nThe tagline is the subject of current interest because it recently snapped in a progress capture during the Paradise Highline Community mile long US record attempt (more about the failure below). Although it is quite strong, its practical limit was found in its performance in progress capture devices. This testing has been performed in order to provide reliable data on the breaking strength of this cord in the widest variety of progress capture devices possible, along with common knots. Hopefully this will provide better information for planning and on site decision making for big rigs, as well as facilitate better failure analysis of the US mile project.\n\n### Information on Pull Rope\n\nDouble Braid Pull Rope is significantly cheaper than 6mm cord, and is rated about 60% stronger (compared to 7.3 kN Maxim cord). There is no published weight for Pull Rope, although it is likely heavier than 6mm accessory cord. It comes with spliced eyes on both ends, which are commonly believed to be full strength despite there being no claim to that effect from the manufacturer. Because it is full polyester, it is also quite low stretch. It has been seen as a great tagline for large projects due to it's low cost, high strength, and suitability for use in powered winches. \n\n![Micro Trax with desheathed Pull rope](notes/images/MicroTraxBrokenCord.jpeg)\n\n### Tagline Failure at US Mile Project\n\nDuring the Paradise Highlines US Mile (1670m) attempt, the Double Braid Pull Rope snapped while pulling the webbing across. At the time, there was roughly 1200m of Slacktivity Y2K in the gap. On the static side, the Pull Rope went through a kootenay pulley, then a Petzl Mini Traxion, before going into a gas powered winch. During the hold which preceded the failure, a Micro Traxion had been added between the Mini Trax and the winch but was not yet holding tension. The Mini Traxion was intended to be a backup in case the winch slipped, and in order to pass the soft shackle connections between sections of Pull Rope, a pulley system attached to two in-line handled ascenders was used to get the soft shackles from in front of the Mini Traxion to behind the winch.\n\nDuring holds, the winch engine was having difficulty turning over with so much tension on the line (estimated at up to 4kN depending on the wind). As a solution, the static side team decided to remove wraps from the winch (from 4 wraps to 2), releasing tension onto the Mini Traxion. This is very dangerous, as [this report of a winch incident](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slackchat/permalink/6791126417627844/) indicates, but was the solution that the team decided on during the rig. They had performed this operation succesfully on an earlier hold, but at the time of the incident, as soon as wraps were removed from the winch the tagline snapped at the Mini Traxion, shooting violently out from the cliff, breaking a carabiner attached to the kootenay, and causing 1200m of webbing to drop into the trees below.\n\n![Broken carabiner from mile project](notes/images/SnappedCarabiner.jpg)\n\nThe system used was not ideal, and the failure could have been prevented with some small changes, like moving the backup progress capture to behind the winch or using a different method of reducing tension on the winch to help it turn over. However, it seems the system that was used was chosen because of the high strength rating of the Pull Rope, and a lack of awareness about the limitations of progress capture devices. Hopefully, this testing will shed light on the forces involved during the actual incident, and help provide useful data on the strength of used Pull Rope in devices.\n\n## Testing Details\n\nThis testing was performed using Balance Community's break test machine taking readings at 500 Hz. Tests were performed by Philip Queen, Ana Lincoln, and Logan Henning. Tests were performed on roughly 2m long segments of Pull Rope, and were terminated on one end in a figure eight unless otherwise mentioned.\n\nThis testing would not have been possible without the generous donation of the remainder of the snapped section of pull rope by Vova Kozlov. \n\n## Interpretation\n\nCapstan and spliced eye values are both weaker than expected, with a capstan to capstan value of 6.79 kN, instead of the 12 kN rating, and a spliced eye value of 5.46 kN. Lower than expected capstan values likely indicate the cord was significantly worn, while low spliced eye values likely indicate the spliced eyes were never full strength. \n\n![Broken pull rope spliced eyes](notes/images/PullRopeSplicedEyes.jpeg)\n\nFor knots, the Figure 8s tested were stronger than the weaker spliced eye at 5.6 kN. Alpine Bends and Double Sheet Bends were both weaker than figure 8s, but similar to each other, at 4.6 and 4.7 kN respectively.\n\nFor toothed progress capture devices, the Petzl Pro Traxion performed the best at 3.9 kN. Unlike in the [Farmer Boy testing](notes/FarmerBoyKnotsDevices), the Micro Traxion (3.2 kN) outperformed the Mini Traxion (3.1 kN), which also slipped at 2.9kN in the same test. The Edelrid Spoc was also tested, and matched the Mini Trax at 3.1 kN. The Micro Trax was tested doubled, and performed significantly better at 4.33 kN, the best of any of the toothed progress captures. We also attempted to test the Mini Trax doubled, and the one sample broke at 4.11 kN, but wedged in between the sideplate and the pulley, and more testing seemed to risk hurting the device. \n\nA second set of tests was done on the Pro Trax with an extra meter or more of space between the termination knot and Trax in order to see if the short space between the knot and device in the tests was influencing the breaking strength. The results were not significantly different (3.9 kN for the short distance, 3.7 kN for the longer distance), indicating the short throw distance used in these tests was not problematic. \n\n![Mini Trax to Micro Trax setup](notes/images/MiniToMicroSetup.jpeg)\n\nWe also tested a chained Mini Trax and Micro Trax to try to replicate the Paradise Mile failure and see if chaining toothed progress captures does improve their performance. The tagline was loaded into the Mini Trax, and then the tail was loaded into a Micro Trax about a foot away and at a shallow angle from the direction of pull. This broke at 5.1 kN, showing a massive benefit to chaining progress captures. This test does not adequately reflect the setup of the mile failure though, because the Micro Trax had not yet seen tension since nothing had pulled behind it yet. \n\nThree configurations of handled ascenders were tested. A standard, single handled ascender broke at 3.3 kN. Two handled ascenders, chained in line with a carabiner, broke at 4.2 kN after slipping at 3.5 kN. The same two ascenders, connected with a sliding X in a short nylon sling instead of a carabiner, broke higher at 4.5 kN. \n\n![Ropeman 1 with broken cord stuck in sideplate](notes/images/Ropeman1.jpeg)\n\nOf the three standard camming devices tested, the Kong Duck performed the best at 3.6 kN. This outperformed the Petzl Micro Trax but not the Pro Trax, showing that the general rule that camming devices preserve more strength than toothed devices is false. The Roll N Lock also slightly outperformed the Micro Trax at 3.4 kN, while the Wild Country Ropeman 1 broke as low as 1.6 kN. We also tested an old Rock Exotica cam, which we were not able to find a device name for, but which broke very high at 4.2 kN, but began slipping at 2.1kN. We did one test each of the Petzl Rescuecender (an older than current model), which broke at 1.6 kN, and the very cheap Nite Ize CamJam XT, which broke at 3.9 kN. The CamJam continues to impress for a device costing only $15, although its design makes it very impractical for use on bigger lines where knots in the tagline will have to be passed.\n\n![Rock Exotica camming device of unknown name](notes/images/RockExoticaCam.jpeg)\n\nFinally, we tested three configurations of 4 wrap prusiks. The first was made out of a short sling of Pull Rope, which broke very high 5.2 kN, but started slipping as early as 1.7 kN. We also did one test each of two models of Sterling Hollow Blocks. The 6.8mm, rectangular style hollow block, slipped at .8 kN and never was able to hold more tension. The 5mm round style hollow block slipped at 2.7 kN, and also was unable to hold more tension.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIn the worn Pull Rope, the spliced eyes have a small advantage over just terminating the sections in a Figure 8. The Figure 8 based Flemish Bend (untested) would be the strongest direct connection, although much more difficult to untie than an Alpine Bend or Double Sheet Bend, which were indistinguishable in this testing. \n\nFor progress capture devices, the Petzl Pro Trax was the best performing, followed by the Kong Duck. If doubling the tagline in the device is suitable for your project, the double wrapped Mini Trax outperformed all of the single wrapped devices. Whichever device is chosen, if it is possible to reach forces near 3 kN, using multiple devices in line (with tension pulled through both) will significantly increase your safety margin. \n\nTwo handled ascenders connected with a sliding X outperformed all other progress captures, and if there is a way to mind them (by having slight tension pulled from the front of the ascenders) they are the best option for high tension use of Pull Rope. Prusiks made of Pull Rope have a similarly high break strength, but have a tendency to slip badly. They may be a good, cheap backup option to the main progress capture, and could also serve as a tension limiting device.\n\n## Results\n\nFor full break test results, see [Pull Rope Full Break Tests](notes/PullRopeFullBreakTest.md).

Two premade grogs per connection point\n\t- At home, you should make sure you've made your brummel correctly, have bury lengths \u003e4\" (measured from the brummel), have evenly split your dyneema when making the holes (6 strands on each side of the splice for 12 strand braids), and have practiced making grogs enough to feel *very* comfortable making them.\n\t- If you're new to making grogs, consider having someone double check your grogs while you're still at home - in person ideally, or over the phone or internet. \n2. A fid that works well with your amsteel\n\t- If using selma fids, I highly recommend sizing up compared to the diameter of your amsteel. For example, use a 5.5 for 5mm amsteel, or a 7.5 for 6mm amsteel.\n3. The webbing pieces to connect\n4. Someone to double check your work\n\nThat's it! No tape or measuring tools required. \n\n## How to Resplice a Grog in the Field\n1. Take apart your grog. \n\t- I normally leave the grogs attached to the webbing bag for the segment they will be connecting. For transportation and storage, I leave the tails unburied but the brummel made.\n2. Pass the loose dyneema of the first grog through all points you are connecting.\n\t- Make sure you get every loop you need to splice in. In some cases, that's either both main loops or both backup loops. In other cases, it will be all four, or may include DLV or Y2K style loops. \n\t- It may help to push the loops to one side (towards the center of the grog, opposite the splices) to give yourself more room to splice.\n3. Identify the strand that has the sharper bend left over from the brummel (strand A). This is the strand that will be **spliced through** first. \n\t- If you have trouble identifying which strand is spliced through first, consider marking it while taking apart the brummel.\n4. Pass the other strand (strand B) through strand A at the hole left over from the old brummel. Make sure you pull strand B through far enough that the hole in strand B has passed through the hole in strand A.\n5. Pass strand A through the hole in strand B and pull on the loop created to make sure you've made a proper brummel. \n6. Bury the tail of strand A back in direction it started from.\n\t- The brummel will have a hole on the strand A side, that enters into the braid of the main loop. On this side of the grog, you can splice the tail directly back into the hole. \n7. Bury the tail of Strand B back in direction it started from.\n\t- The brummel on this side won't have a clear hole like the other side. Choose the closest *pick* (a V-shape made by the braid of the amsteel) to the brummel that's fully accessible. You should be able to bury this tail without interfering with the brummel. Generally I can see one pick that would be quite difficult to splice, and I choose the next pick down from that one to bury into.\n8. Repeat steps 2-7 with your second grog.\n9. Inspect both grogs well to ensure everything was done right. \n\n## Key Points for Field Spliced Grogs\nThis list will cover the most important things to make sure of when field splicing grogs. It leaves out some of the key points for *making grogs* because it assumes the grogs were premade properly beforehand, and are just being respliced. Some of the main things its missing are checking proper bury length, and making sure the original holes are made to split the braid evenly (i.e. 6 strands on each side of the hole for 12 strand amsteel).\n\n1. Make sure the brummel is properly done. Each strand should go through the other once, and be spliced through once. Pulling on either both tails, or opposite sides of the loop shouldn't move the splice at all. \n2. Make sure the tails are buried in the right place. One should go into the hole made by the brummel, and the other should be as close as possible to the brummel (about one pick away from the brummel.) Verify that the exposed tails (between the brummel and start of the buries) don't look bigger than they need to be.\n3. Make sure the ends of the tails aren't sticking out of the end of the bury. The tails should be fully buried, but it can be easy to take the fid out too early while burying them. The side of the grog opposite the brummel should be smooth with no loose strands sticking out. The only feature of that side is a small thin spot between the buries. \n4. Make sure you have connected exactly what you think you connected. In addition to connecting the right sides of the webbing, making both mains on top and right side up, etc., verify that everything that needs to be connected *for safety* is. Pull on both mains, both main and backup pairs, and both backups separately to make sure every failure mode is protected. \n\nThis should cover the main potential mistakes in field splicing the grogs, assuming the grogs were made properly beforehand. Premaking the grogs is key to eliminating decision making on site, which in turn helps reduce the possibility for errors. There may be other mistakes that I've missed though.
