My personal experience with them has been fantastic, and the consensus among experienced highliners who've walked over them is that they are the easiest connections to pass they've tried. Now, with full testing, I feel prepared to release this new method to the public. They are weird, and might challenge some existing notions about split connections, but their benefits are worth a shift in mindset. So what is a grog, how do you make one, how strong are they, and where should I use them? Keep reading to learn all there is to know about grog splices.\n\n## What is a Grog?\nA grog is a method of splicing a continuous loop of braided material that makes use of a brummel splice, but buries each tail back in the working strand on the side it came from. Here is the [animated knots page for the grog sling](https://www.animatedknots.com/grog-sling-knot), which has good pictures and some discussion of grogs (some of the discussion does not match the testing found below, or the first hand experience I have of using grogs while slacklining).\n\nOur particular interest in grogs is as a connection method in highline splits, as a replacement for soft shackles and quicklinks. If you're just interested in how they can be an improvement over other connection options, skip to [Benefits of the Grog](#Benefits of the Grog). But if you'd like a deeper dive into how and why the idea for using them came about, keep reading here. \n\n### Origins\nTo my knowledge, grogs were first used in slacklining as the manufacturer recommended way of re-splicing the Souz Snatch, which was originally shipped with a weak splice that had a tendency fully unraveling during normal use. \n\nBut the idea of using them in split connections first appeared in discussions between me and Owen Roll. I had been making a lot of variations of continuous loops in dyneema, and showed Owen some of the variations I had tried splicing. I had deemed them useless for splits because they don't open like a soft shackle, but Owen convinced me of the benefits. Fairly quickly we seemed to settle on the grog as being the best continuous loop method for the job. Sirio Zao made a [post on SlackChat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slackchat/posts/5048334728573697/) asking about use of a grog in splits in combination with a soft shackle before Owen and I shared our idea publicly, and no one seemed to have used them previously or be convinced to try them.\n\nThe first use of them in a split was by Jerry Miszewski on a 200m permarig in the fall of 2021, after I brought the idea to him and we break tested some I had made. I rigged lines with them at the Halloween Fruitbowl Gathering and GGBY, also in the fall of 2021, along with some other rigs. Jerry's line had 5mm grogs with 6\" buries and lock stitching on one side. My lines used 5mm grogs with 3-4\" buries and no lock stitching, and even rigged for days at a time at a festival saw no problems with the buries coming undone. The grogs were exceptionally easy to walk over, easy to splice and unsplice, and apparently safe enough. But I waited until now to share the grog in order to make sure I tested them fully before advocating them to the general public. \n\n### Semi-Permanent Split Connections\nOne of the main benefits of split connections is the ability to connect and disconnet separate pieces of webbing, instead of needing two long pieces of webbing capable of spanning the whole gap. Doesn't splicing a continuous loop through your webbing negate the adjustability of your split rig? It would, if these splices were permanent, but they aren't. \n\nGrog splices are semi-permanent, but not permanent. They can be left in place for a long time, but easily removed and reused at will. It takes me roughly ten minutes to connect two highline segments with grogs, and about a minute to take them apart after they've been tensioned. I've done this at home and right at the anchor, which shows that field splicing with grogs is doable for someone who is used to making them. \n\nAlso, if you own a long rig, it is easy to pre-splice your segments in a smart way to give you optimal flexibility across different webbing lengths. For example, if you own six 50m highline segments, you can connect three 50m segments in one bag, two 50m segments in another bag, and leave the final 50m segment in it's own bag. For any line up to 150m, you have a bag already packed with no need to make any connections. From 150-250m, you have to combine 2 bags with one split either at home or on site. For lines from 250-300m, you have to make 2 connections at home or on site. In all of these cases you have full flexibility, with minimal need to make connections for a specific rig. You also maintain the safety benefits of a split rig in every case, without having the hassle of making up to 5 connections while packing for a rig.\n\n### Continuous Loops in Dyneema\nWhy use a grog instead of another method of making a continuous loop? You can read all about some different ways of making continuous loops [at the sailing website L-36](https://l-36.com/loop.php), but even this isn't an exhaustive source. Like soft shackles, there are many ways of accomplishing the same thing with different strengths and tradeoffs. The primary reason for chosing a grog for split connections is having a secure splice (thanks to the brummel) without having to lock stitch. Lock stitching is relatively more difficult and time consuming than splicing, and slackliners might either be put off by the annoyance or be tempted to skip the lock stitch (risking full failure of the splice). Plus, lock stitching would require the loops be much more permanent than semi-permanent.\n\n## Benefits of the Grog\n- size/sleekness/ease of passing\n- weight\n- security\n- no tape\n\n\n## How to make a Grog\n### Buries are key\n\n## Breaktests\nDisclaimer: the breaktests were performed at the Balance Community workshop using their breaktest machine, and with the assistance of Balance Community founder Jerry Miszewski. \nSee the full breaktests at [the complete breaktest page](notes/GrogSpliceFullBreakTest).\n\n| Bury Size | Sample Number | Splice Orientation | Break Strength in kN |\n| --- | --- | --- | ----------- |\n| 4\" | 1 | Grog up | 31.8 |\n| 4\" | 2 | Grog up | 27.3 |\n| 4\" | 3 | Grog up | 35.9 |\n| 4\" | 4 | Grog down | 30.6 |\n| 4\" | 5 | Grog down | 29.0 |\n| 4\" | 6 | Grog down | 32.1 |\n| 5\" | 1 | Grog down | 27.2 |\n| 5\" | 2 | Grog down | 29.6 |\n| 5\" | 3 | Grog down | 32.2 |\n| 3\" | 1 | Grog down | 25.5 |\n| 3\" | 2 | Grog down | 26.2 |\n| 3\" | 3 | Grog up | 28.5 |\n| 2\" | 1 | Grog up | 21.4 |\n| 6\" | 1 | Grog up | 30.6 |\n| 6\" | 2 | Grog up | 31.3 |\n| 6\" | 3 | Grog up | 31.1 |\n| 3\" | 4 | Grog up | 20.8 |\n| 4\" | 7 | Grog up | 27.8 |\n| 6\" | 4 | Grog up | 26.4 |\n| 6\" | 5 | Grog up | 34.2 |\n\n\n\n## Conclusion (Suggested Uses)\n\n### Disclaimer\nWhile I have done significant testing of grog splices, and have used them on numerous high traffic rigs to test them personally, I cannot guarantee the grogs you may use on your line, especially if only instructed from the internet. Use grogs at your own risk, and only if you feel comfortable with the information presented here.","lastmodified":"2022-07-13T06:21:58.869229944Z","tags":null}}
